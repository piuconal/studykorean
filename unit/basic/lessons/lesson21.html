      <div id="target-id6783d2cb7c671" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>As an adverb, 언제 can be used to ask “when” something happens. For example:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-40.mp3">집에 언제 갔어?</a> = When
          did you go home?<br />

          그 여자가 언제 사라졌어요? = When did that girl disappear?<br />
          낮잠을 언제 잤어요? = When did you take a nap?<br />
          아빠가 언제 왔나요? = When did dad come?
        </p>
        <p>Particles like ~부터 and ~까지, which are often used to indicate from/until when something happens can be
          attached to 언제 to indicate that it is unknown “from/until when” something happens. For example:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-45.mp3">언제부터 아팠어요?</a> = Since
          when have you been sick?<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-46.mp3">한국에서 언제까지 있을 거예요?</a> =
          Until when will you be in Korea?<br />
          언제부터 한국어를 공부했어요? = Since when have you been studying Korean?
        </p>
        <p>언제 can also be attached to “이다” to ask “when” something is. In these cases as well, it replaces the noun that
          would normally be attached to 이다. For example:</p>
        <p>결혼식은 언제야? = When is the wedding?<br />
          방학은 언제야? = When is vacation?</p>

      <div id="target-id6783d2cb7c689" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>어디 can be used to ask “where” something happened if the place is unknown. For example:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-50.mp3">어디 가고 싶어요?</a> = Where
          do you want to go?<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-51.mp3">어디 살아요?</a> = Where do
          you live?<br />
          그것을 어디서 하고 싶어요? = Where do you want to do that?<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-53.mp3">어디에서 왔어요?</a> = Where
          are you from (from where did you come?)
        </p>
        <p>The particle ~까지 is commonly attached to 어디. ~부터 is not commonly attached to 어디 for the same reason that ~부터
          is not commonly attached to a place, as described in Lesson 12. For example:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-54.mp3">어디까지 가고 싶어요?</a> = How
          far/until where do you want to go?<br />
          지하철을 어디까지 탈 거예요? = Until where will we ride the subway?</p>
        <p>Like 언제, it can also be used as the noun before 이다 to ask where something “is.” For example:<br />
          어디야? = Where are you?</p>
        <p>This is really only done when speaking to a person, and you are asking him/her directly where he/she is. When
          asking where another person, or another thing is, it is more natural to use 있다 in the sentence. For example:
        </p>
        <p>친구가 어디에 있어요? = Where is your friend?<br />
          엄마가 어디에 있어요? = Where is mom?<br />
          펜이 어디에 있어요? = Where is the pen?</p>

        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “역씨”</p>
        <p>Notes: Similar to the particle ~도. However, 역시 does not get added directly to nouns.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Asking Questions in Korean</span></p>
      <p align="left">Asking questions in Korean, at first glance, is very easy. For the most part, asking questions in
        Korean without the use of a “question” word (who/what/when/where/why/how/how much/how many) is incredibly
        simple.</p>
      <p align="left">Asking questions in English is unnecessarily complicated. If I asked you the question “Do you like
        sports?” In English, what is the meaning of the word “do” in that sentence? In English, whenever we ask a
        question (without a question word), we need to include the words did/do/will to make the listener know that we
        are asking a question.</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Did</span> you go to the park?<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          Do</span> you like sports?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          Will</span> you eat with us?</p>
      <p align="left">It is so confusing in English, and my two sentence explanation doesn’t really explain it very
        well. Luckily, this is not an English learning website! You are here to learn how to ask questions in Korean.
        Enough of this English nonsense.</p>
      <p align="left">In Korean, if you are asking a question that does not require the use of a question word (one more
        time: who/what/when/where/why/how/how much/how many) you don’t need to do anything structurally to make that
        sentence a question. All you need to do is raise the intonation of the end of the sentence to make it sound like
        a question. For example, if you want to say “My mother ate” you already know that you can say:</p>
      <p align="left">엄마는 먹었어요 = My mom ate</p>
      <p align="left">But if you want to ask somebody “did you eat?” You just raise the intonation of the end of the
        sentence to make it sound like a question:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-1.mp3">엄마는 먹었어요?</a>
        = (literally means “did mom eat?”)</p>
      <p align="left">Remember that Korean people rarely say the word “you,” so if you ask a question to the person you
        are talking to <em>about </em>the person you are talking to, you can just omit the subject of the sentence.</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-2.mp3">밥을 먹었어?</a> =
        Did (you) eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-3.mp3">집에 갔어?</a> = Did (you) go
        home?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-4.mp3">소식을 들었어?</a> = Did (you)
        hear the news?
      </p>
      <p align="left">If you are talking to somebody and the subject of the sentence is not the person who you are
        talking to, you can just use the subject as normal. Also notice that regardless of the tense of the sentence
        (past/present/future) you don’t need to do anything special other than raise the intonation at the end of the
        sentence:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-5.mp3">남동생은
          울었어요?</a> = Did your brother cry?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-6.mp3">한국은 좋은 나라야?</a> = Is Korea
        a good country?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-7.mp3">엄마도 올 거야?</a> = Will mom
        come too?
      </p>
      <p align="left">As I said, you don’t need to change anything structurally in these sentences to make them
        questions. There are, however, a few ways that you can change the structure of a sentence to make the sentence a
        question (if you want).</p>

      <p align="left">The formal high respect ~습니다 is never used as a question. When asking a question in this form,
        instead of using ~습니다 you must use ~ㅂ/습니까. ~ㅂ니까 gets added directly to stems ending in a vowel, and ~습니까 gets
        added after a stem ending in a consonant. You can do this with all tenses:</p>

        <li>Has the mirror been wiped clean?</li>

        <li>Is the toilet paper ready?</li>

        <li>Is there any smell?</li>
        <li>Are there any places, the doorknob, the faucet, etc that are broken?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are other ways you can change a sentence to make it a question. ~ㅂ/습니까 is typically the most formal. We
        will talk about the others in the upcoming sections.</p>
      <h3><a name="213"></a></h3>

      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Questions ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">니</span></p>
      <p>When asking a question, instead of ending your sentences with ~아/어, you can end them with ~니. This is an
        informal way to ask a question, and you can do this in all tenses. For example:</p>
      <p align="left">Past tense: 했니, 먹었니, 갔니, 이었니<br />
        Present tense: 하니, 먹니, 가니, 이니<br />
        Future tense (~겠): 하겠니, 먹겠니, 가겠니<br />
        Future tense (~ㄹ 것이다): 할 거니, 할 것이니, 먹을 거니, 먹을 것이니</p>
      <p>However, note that using this form gives the sentence a slightly feminine feel to it (I’ve never once used ~니).
        However, I work at a Korean high school, and I hear female Korean teachers use this form all the time when
        asking questions to a student.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-7/">Lesson 7</a>, you
        learned how irregular words change as a result of adding different additions. This is the first time you have
        been introduced to adding ~니.</p>
      <p>The ㄹ irregular applies when adding ~니. When you add ~니 to a stem of a word that ends in ㄹ, you must drop the ㄹ
        from the stem, and attach the grammatical principle to the remainder of the word. For example:</p>
      <p>열다 + ~니 = 여니</p>
      <p>As you know, some additions require the speaker to choose between two possible options – for example, choosing
        between ~아 and ~어 when adding ~아/어. Notice that when adding ~니 there is no choice. I call this a “solid ㄴ.” That
        is, there is only one choice, and it starts with ㄴ.</p>
      <p>In later lessons, you will learn other grammatical additions that have a solid ㄴ. For example:</p>
      <p>~나 (<a href="#21new">later in this lesson</a>)<br />
        ~는 (<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lesson
          26</a>)<br />
        ~는데 (<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/upper-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-4-lessons-76-83/lesson-76/">Lesson
          76</a>)<br />
        ~네 (<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/upper-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-4-lessons-76-83/lesson-83/">Lesson

        ~나 (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-5/lessons-109-116/lesson-109/">Lesson 109</a>)</p>
      <p>All grammatical additions where a solid ㄴ is attached to a word follow the same rule as when ~니 is added. Below
        are some examples of ~니 in use with the ㄹ irregular:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-6.mp3">뭐 만드니?</a> = What are you
        making?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-7.mp3">마음에 드니?</a> = Do you like
        it?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-8.mp3">어디 사니?</a> = Where do you
        live?
      </p>
      <p>~니 also affects the ㅎ irregular, which is introduced in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-23/">Lesson 23</a>.</p>

      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Questions </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~ㄴ/은가(요)</span></span></p>
      <p>Just like ‘~니’ you can also end your questions with ~ㄴ/은가(요). Adding &#8220;요&#8221; to the end makes it more
        formal. This form is less formal than the high-respect ~ㅂ/습니까 form.</p>
      <p>~ㄴ/은가(요) gets added to the stem of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adjectives</span>. Using this form
        makes a question a little bit softer than using the forms described previously. The exact difference cannot be
        translated perfectly, but sort of like how “would it be okay if I go into the park?” sounds slightly softer than
        “can I go into the park.”</p>
      <p align="left">You add ~ㄴ/은 to adjective stems just like you would when conjugating it to describe a noun:<br />
        예쁘다 + ㄴ/은 = 예쁜<br />
        작다 + ㄴ/은 = 작은</p>
      <p align="left">And then attach “가(요)” after that construction:<br />
        예쁜가(요)?<br />
        작은가(요)?</p>
      <p>It is only conjugated into the present tense and therefore usually only used to ask about some sort of present
        situation. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-19.mp3">그 여자는 예쁜가?</a> = Is that
        girl pretty?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-20.mp3">이것은 너무 작은가요?</a> = Is this
        too small?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-9.mp3">그 학교가 좋은가?</a> = Is that
        school good?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-10.mp3">일이 너무 복잡한가요?</a> = Is
        this work/task too complicated?
      </p>
      <p>~ㄴ/은가(요) is commonly added to 이다 as well. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-11.mp3">그 사람이 선생님인가?</a> = Is
        that person a teacher?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-12.mp3">그 사람이 우리 엄마인가?</a> = Is
        that person our mom? (Is that our mom?)
      </p>
      <p>아닌가(요)? Is very commonly used at the end of a full sentence to say “no?” when you are asking yourself a
        question as if you are doubting yourself. For example:</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Questions ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">나</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">요</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>Using ~나(요) at the end of a sentence to ask a question has the same function of ~ㄴ/은가(요). That is, it can be
        used to make a question sound slightly softer than the other ways to ask a question. However, ~나(요) is more
        often used with verbs and with 있다 and 없다. For example:</p>
      <p><em>Notice that the </em>ㄹ <em>irregular needs to be applied in appropriate situations again:</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-14.mp3">밥이 있나?</a> = Is there
        rice?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-15.mp3">사과도 여기서 파나요?</a> = Do you
        sell apples here too?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-16.mp3">소녀시대 콘서트를 여기서 하나요?</a> =
        Is the Girl’s Generation concert here?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-17.mp3">지하철을 타고 있나요?</a> = Are
        you on (riding) the subway now?
      </p>
      <p>This form can be used in the past tense as well. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-18.mp3">교통카드가 있었나요?</a> = Did
        you have your bus (transportation) card?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-19.mp3">그 소식을 들었나요?</a> = Did you
        hear that/the news?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-20.mp3">만화책을 샀나요?</a> = Did you
        buy the comic book?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-21.mp3">어제 병원에 입원했나요?</a> = Did
        you go to the hospital yesterday?
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to use this in the future tense, but it only sounds natural when applying it to the ~겠다 future
        conjugation. Adding ~나(요) to 이다 is typically not done, and therefore adding it to words that are conjugating
        using ~ㄹ/을 것이다 is unnatural. For example:</p>
      <p>내일 퇴원할 거나요? &#8211; unnatural<br />
        내일 퇴원할 것이나요? &#8211; unnatural</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;" align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Question Words</span>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Depending on which question word you are using, building a question can be really easy or really
        confusing. I will teach you the easy examples in this lesson (who, when, where, why) and the more confusing
        examples in the next lesson (what, how, how much/how many).</p>
      <h3><a name="216"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">왜</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>Why (왜) is probably the easiest question word in Korean. ‘왜’ is an adverb, which means it can be used/placed as
        an adverb in sentences. Many of the question words that you will learn in this lesson (and the following lesson)
        are adverbs. As you know, adverbs can be used very freely in sentences and do not have any specific location
        that they need to be used. However, the most common position for these adverb-question words is before the verb.
        If there are other adverbs in the sentence (including the negative “안”) the question word is usually placed
        first.</p>
      <p>With these adverb-question words, you can typically just take a statement and change it into a question by
        inserting the word into the sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>만화책을 좋아합니까? = Do you like comic books?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-35.mp3">만화책을 왜 좋아합니까?</a> = Why do
        you like comic books?
      </p>
      <p>(저는) 한국어를 공부하고 있어요 = I am studying Korean<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-36.mp3">한국어를 왜 공부하고 있어요?</a> = Why
        are you studying Korean?
      </p>
      <p>(저는) 너무 빨리 먹었어요 = I ate really fast<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-37.mp3">왜 너무 빨리 먹었어요?</a> = Why
        did you eat so fast?
      </p>
      <p>(저는) 어제 학교에 안 갔어요 = I didn’t go to school yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-22.mp3">어제 학교에 왜 안 갔어요?</a> = Why
        didn’t you go to school yesterday?
      </p>
      <p>왜 is also used to respond when somebody calls your name (because they want you for some reason). In English, we
        would say “what,” but in Korean, they say “왜.” For example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-23.mp3">슬기야!</a> =
        Seulgi!<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-23.mp3">왜?</a> =
        Why/what do you want?</p>
      <p>Notice that saying “why” in English is unnatural. This is how they say it in Korean.</p>
      <h3><a name="217"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">언제</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>The usage of ‘when’ (언제) is very similar to the usage of ‘왜’ in Korean. As an adverb, it can be used to ask
        “when” something happens. For example:</p>
      <p>집에 갔어? = Did you go home?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-40.mp3">집에 언제 갔어?</a> = When did
        you go home?
      </p>
      <p>집에 갈 거야? = Will you go home?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-41.mp3">집에 언제 갈 거야?</a> = When
        will you go home?
      </p>
      <p>그 여자가 사라졌어요 = That girl disappeared<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-24.mp3">그 여자가 언제 사라졌어요?</a> =
        When did that girl disappear?
      </p>
      <p>낮잠을 잤어요? = Did you take a nap?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-25.mp3">낮잠을 언제 잤어요?</a> = When
        did you take a nap?
      </p>
      <p>아빠가 왔어요? = Did dad come?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-26.mp3">아빠가 언제 왔나요?</a> = When
        did dad come?
      </p>
      <p>Particles like ~부터 and ~까지, which are often used to indicate from/until when something happens can be attached
        to 언제 to indicate that it is unknown “from/until when” something happens. For example:</p>
      <p>어제부터 아팠어요 = I have been sick since yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-45.mp3">언제부터 아팠어요?</a> = Since
        when have you been sick?<br />
        <em>Notice that </em>어제<em> and </em>언제<em> are not the same word.</em>
      </p>
      <p>한국에서 내년까지 있을 거예요 = I will be in Korea until next year<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-46.mp3">한국에서 언제까지 있을 거예요?</a> =
        Until when will you be in Korea?
      </p>
      <p>작년부터 한국어를 공부했어요 = I have been studying Korean since last year<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-27.mp3">언제부터 한국어를 공부했어요?</a> =
        Since when have you been studying Korean?
      </p>
      <p>언제 can also be attached to “이다” to ask “when” something is. In these cases as well, it replaces the noun that
        would normally be attached to 이다. For example:</p>
      <p>결혼식은 내일이야 = The wedding is tomorrow<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-28.mp3">결혼식은 언제야?</a> = When is
        the wedding?
      </p>
      <p>방학은 다음 주야 = Vacation is next week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-29.mp3">방학은 언제야?</a> = When is
        vacation?
      </p>
      <p>The grammatical principle ~든지 is commonly attached to 언제 to form 언제든지. For now, you can think of this simply as
        a word that means “whenever.” When you learn about the function of ~든지 in <a
          title="Lesson 106: Listing Possibilities/Outcomes: ~든지 (간에)"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-5/lessons-101-108/lesson-106/">Lesson 106</a>, you will understand
        how this meaning is formed.</p>
      <h3><a name="218"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">어디</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>어디 works very much like 언제. It can be used to ask “where” something happened if the place is unknown. For
        example:</p>
      <p>집에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go home<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-50.mp3">어디 가고 싶어요?</a> = Where do
        you want to go?
      </p>
      <p>한국에 살아요 = I live in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-51.mp3">어디 살아요?</a> = Where do you
        live?
      </p>
      <p><em>Just like </em>여기<em>, ~</em>에<em> is often omitted from “</em>어디<em>.” </em>어디에서<em> is often contracted
          to </em>어디서<em>. </em></p>
      <p>More examples:<br />
        그것을 집에서 하고 싶어요 = I want to do that at home<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-30.mp3">그것을 어디서 하고 싶어요?</a> =
        Where do you want to do that?
      </p>
      <p>한국에서 왔어요 = I came from Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-53.mp3">어디에서 왔어요?</a> = Where are
        you from (from where did you come?)
      </p>
      <p>The particle ~까지 is commonly attached to 어디. ~부터 is not commonly attached to 어디 for the same reason that ~부터 is
        not commonly attached to a place, as described in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-12/chinese/">Lesson 12</a>. For
        example:</p>
      <p>부산까지 가고 싶어요 = I want to go until Busan<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-54.mp3">어디까지 가고 싶어요?</a> = How
        far/until where do you want to go?
      </p>
      <p>지하철을 서울역까지 탈 거예요 = We will take/ride the Subway until Seoul Station<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-31.mp3">지하철을 어디까지 탈 거예요?</a> =
        Until where will we ride the subway?
      </p>
      <p>Like 언제, it can be used as the noun before 이다 to ask where something “is.”</p>
      <p>Placing 어디 before 이다 is really only done if asking somebody directly where they are:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-32.mp3">어디야?</a> = Where are
        you?</p>
      <p>Or when asking where a place is:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-33.mp3">너의 집이 어디야?</a> = Where is
        your house?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-34.mp3">그곳이 어디야?</a> = Where is
        that place?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-35.mp3">학교가 어디예요?</a> = Where is
        the/your school?
      </p>
      <p>When asking where another person, or an object is, it is more natural to use 있다 in these sentence. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-36.mp3">친구가 어디에 있어요?</a> = Where
        is your friend?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-37.mp3">엄마가 어디에 있어요?</a> = Where
        is mom?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-38.mp3">펜이 어디에 있어요?</a> = Where
        is the pen?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-39.mp3">아빠가 어디에 있어?</a> = Where
        is dad?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-40.mp3">그 만화책이 어디에 있어?</a> =
        Where is that comic?
      </p>
      <p>These would be unnatural:</p>
      <p>아빠가 어디야?<br />
        그 만화책이 어디야?</p>
      <p>Just like 언제, there are of course more complicated ways that 어디 can be used. For now, this is good enough.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="219"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">누구</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>In Korean, 누구 has the function of a pronoun.</p>
      <p><em>Actually, some of the ways you use 언제 and 어디 in Korean are pronouns. I chose not to explain this to you
          because the definition of a pronoun in Korean and English is not exactly the same. </em>언제<em> and </em>어디
        <em>can act as pronouns in Korean, but this same usage would be called an adverb in English. I actually had an
          explanation typed out, but decided not to include it into this lesson because it makes things more confusing
          than they actually are. However, knowing that </em>누구 <em>is a pronoun in English and Korean is helpful (if
          you know what pronouns are). </em>
      </p>
      <p>As a pronoun, 누구 can be used in the place of a noun in a sentence – that is, it can be used to replace the
        object, the subject or as a noun before 이다.</p>
      <p>This is the same in English – as you can see in the following three examples:</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> will study Korean tomorrow? – ‘who’ is the
        subject of the sentence<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          Who</span> will you meet tomorrow? – ‘who’ is the object of the sentence -“you” is the subject<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          Who</span> is that person? = ‘who’ is ‘that person’ in the sentence</p>
      <p align="left">However, this is confusing in English because in all three cases “who” is the first word of the
        sentence regardless of its role.<br />
        In Korean, instead of always placing ‘who’ at the start of the sentence, it should be placed in the location of
        the subject (usually the start of the sentence), the object (usually somewhere in the middle of the sentence) or
        before 이다. I will show you an example of each:</p>
      <p align="left">In the third sentence below you can see an example of 누구 being used as a subject. The subject is
        underlined in each case. When 누구 is used as the subject of a sentence, it is changed to 누가.</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">너는</span> 내일 한국어를 공부할 거야 = <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">You</span> will study Korean tomorrow<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          너는</span> 내일 한국어를 공부할 거야? = Will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> study Korean
        tomorrow?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
        </span><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-65.mp3"><span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">누가</span> 내일 한국어를 공부할 거야?</a> = <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> will study Korean tomorrow?</p>
      <p align="left">In the third sentence below you can see an example of 누구 being used as an object. The object is
        underlined in each case. The object particles can be used if 누구 is the object.</p>
      <p align="left">너는 내일 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">친구</span>를 만날 거야 = You will meet a <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">friend</span> tomorrow<br />
        너는 내일 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">친구</span>를 만날 거야? = Will you meet a <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">friend</span> tomorrow?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-66.mp3">너는 내일 <span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">누구</span>(를) 만날 거야?</a> = <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> will you meet tomorrow?
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the third sentence below you can see an example of 누구 being used before 이다:</p>
      <p align="left">그 사람은 너의 아버지야 = That person is your dad<br />
        그 사람은 너의 아버지야? = Is that person your dad?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson21-67.mp3">그 사람은 누구야?</a> = Who is
        that person?
