          style="text-decoration: underline;">고</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 있다</span></p>
      <p>Attaching ~고 있다 to the stem of verbs gives it the meaning of “I am ____ ing,” – as in, I am currently doing
        something. It is called the “present progressive” because the action is being done in the present, and is
        currently “progressing” as time goes on.</p>
      <p>This grammatical form is very common in Korean. Simply attach ~고 있다 to a verb stem:</p>
      <p><em>As you know, </em>있다<em><em> has many usages and meanings in Korean. Sometimes </em></em>있다<em><em> is a
            verb, and sometimes it is an adjective. When used as </em>~</em>고 있다<em><em> as described here,</em>
        </em>있다<em><em> is a verb. </em><em>For now, this is only important to you when conjugating in the plain form.
            In the future, there will be other times when this distinction will be important.</em></em></p>

        am paying the bill now
      </p>
      <p>This same form can be used in the past tense to mean “I was ___ing.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-3.mp3">저는 밥을 먹고 있었어요</a> = I was

        = The students were sleeping during class
      </p>
      <p><em>You learned previously that </em>동안 <em>has the meaning of “for” when placed after an indication of time
          (</em>10년 동안 = <em>for 10 years). However, when placed after a noun, it has the meaning of “during” (</em>방학
        동안<em> = during vacation/</em>수업 시간 동안<em> = during class)</em></p>
      <p>However, using ~고 있다 in the past tense is slightly awkward in Korean. It <em>can</em> be used like this, but it
        is often more natural to use the regular past tense conjugation instead. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-3.mp3">저는 밥을 먹고 있었어요</a> = I was
        eating<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-6.mp3">학생들은 자고 있었어요</a> = The
        students were sleeping
      </p>
      <p>In most situations the sentences above could be said in the following way without any real difference in
        meaning:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-7.mp3">저는 밥을 먹었어요</a> = I
        ate<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-8.mp3">학생들은 잤어요</a> = The
        students slept
      </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, if you really want to stress that you <em>were </em>doing something, you can use this form. More
        examples:</p>
      <p>저는 백화점에서 쇼핑했어요 = I shopped at the department store<br />
        대학생은 책상에서 공부를 했어요 = The university student studied at his desk</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-9.mp3">저는 백화점에서 쇼핑하고 있었어요</a> =
        I was shopping at the department store<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-10.mp3">대학생은 책상에서 공부를 하고 있었어요</a>
        = The university student was studying at his desk
      </p>
      <p>~고 있다 can also be conjugated into the future tense. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-11.mp3">나는 다음 주에 시험 공부를 하고 있을
          거야</a> = Next week, I will be studying for an exam</p>
      <p>But, just like with the past tense of this form, the same meaning can be expressed by just using a regular
        future tense conjugation. Therefore, although the sentence above is correct, the same meaning can be expressed
        by saying:</p>
      <p>저는 다음 주에 시험 공부를 할 거예요 = Next week, I will study for an exam</p>
      <p>~고 있다 can usually be used very easily with most verbs, but there are some special situations that we need to
        talk about before we move on.</p>

      <h3><a name="pp1"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">살고</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"> 있다</span></p>
      <p>In English, we can say “I live in Canada.” You <em>could</em> also say “I am living in Canada,” but to me it
        sounds more natural to say “I live in Canada.” In Korean, however, “살고 있다” is often used when you want to say “I
        live in ________:” For example, both of these are acceptable:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-14.mp3">저는 한국에서 살고 있어요</a> = I
        live in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-15.mp3">저는 한국에서 살아요</a> = I live
        in Korea
      </p>
      <p>살다 (to live) is a little bit strange because you can actually use ‘에서’ or ‘에’ to indicate the place that you
        are living. For example, these are also correct, and have the same meaning as the previous examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-18-s1.mp3">저는 한국에 살고 있어요</a> = I
        live in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-13.mp3">저는 한국에 살아요</a> = I live
        in Korea
      </p>
      <p>Although they both sound natural to Korean speakers, I’ve heard that ~에서 is probably the correct one.</p>
      <h3><a name="pp2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) 알고 있다</span></p>
      <p>In English, almost every verb can go into the “I am ___ing” form. For example:</p>
      <p>I am studying<br />
        I am praying<br />
        I am listening<br />
        I am walking<br />
        I am playing</p>
      <p>However, one word that we would never say that way is</p>
      <p>I am knowing</p>
      <p>In Korean, however, it is very common to say “알고 있다.” Instead of translating this to “I am knowing” it needs to
        be translated to “I know,” because we would never say “I am knowing” in English.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-18.mp3">나는 그것을 알고 있어</a> = I know
        that<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-19.mp3">나는 그것을 알아</a> = I know
        that
      </p>
      <p>While we are on the subject of “알다,” let’s talk about other ways that this word is commonly used.</p>
      <p>When a person tells you something and you want to say “okay,” Korean people would use “알다” in these situations.
        One common time you would want to say “okay” or “알다” in this respect is when responding to a command. I haven’t
        taught you how to give commands yet (you will learn that in <a
          title="Lesson 40: The Imperative Mood: ~아/어(요), ~(으)세요, ~아/어라, (으)십시오, ~지 말다"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-40/">Lesson
          40</a>), but for the moment just accept that “집에 빨리 와” means “come home quickly.”</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-14.mp3">집에 빨리 와!</a> =
        come home quickly<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-14.mp3">알았어</a> = Okay
      </p>
      <p>However, this doesn’t need to be used in response to a command. It could just be any piece of new information
        that you want to say “okay” to. For example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-15.mp3">우리는 내일 6시에 출발
          할 거야</a> = We will leave at 6:00 tomorrow<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-15.mp3">알았어</a> = Okay
      </p>
      <p>In formal situations, it is possible to use “알았어요,” but it is also very common to use the future tense formal
        conjugation of 알겠습니다. For example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-16.mp3">이 일을 내일까지 해야
          합니다</a> = You have to finish this work by tomorrow<br />
        (You haven’t learned the grammar for this sentence yet, so don’t worry about the Korean sentence. Focus more on
        the English sentence, because what I am trying to teach you here is the response to that question in
        Korean)<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-16.mp3">네, 알겠습니다</a> =
        Yes, okay. (I got it)</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="pp3"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">가지고</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"> 있다</span><br />
        A word that you learned in a previous lesson is “가지다.” 가지다 is a verb that means “to have/posses.” You also know
        that you can use 있다 to state that you “have” something. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 펜이 있다 = I have a pen (remember that this usage of 있다 requires that 이/가 be added to the object, because 있다 is
        actually an adjective in this form).</p>
      <p>When using 가지다, however, you would think that you could simply do this:</p>
      <p>나는 펜을 가져 – I have a pen – But, it is not usually said like this. If you want to say that you <em>have
        </em>something using 가지다, you should say “가지고 있다” instead of just “가지다.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-23.mp3">나는 펜을 가지고 있어</a> = I have
        a pen<br />
        Just like how we don’t say “I am knowing” in English, we also wouldn’t say “I am having.” Therefore, when
        translating “~를/을 가지고 있다” into English, you need to say “I have ____.”</p>
      <p>If you want to talk about ‘people’ that you ‘have,’ you should never use “가지고 있다.’ Instead, you should use just
        ‘있다.’ For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-24.mp3">나는 여자 친구가 있어</a> = I have
        a girlfriend<br />
        나는 여자 친구를 가지고 있어 – this technically means “I have a girlfriend,” but it’s meaning is more similar to “I possess
        a girlfriend.” If you say something like this in Korean, Korean people will probably understand you, but laugh
        at your mistake (similar to if somebody told me that they possess a girlfriend in English).</p>
      <h3><a name="pp4"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using 고 있다 with Position Verbs</span></p>
      <p>In the previous lesson, you learned that you cannot add ~고 to position verbs. Examples of these verbs were:</p>
      <p>앉다 = to sit<br />
        서다 = to stand</p>
      <p>Specifically, I said:</p>
      <p>“These position verbs usually act differently than regular verbs (not just in this situation, but in many
        situations).”</p>
      <p>~고 있다 is another situation where these position verbs act differently than regular verbs.</p>
      <p>First of all, adding ~고 있다 to these verbs <em>can</em> be done. For example:</p>
      <p>저는 앉고 있다 = I am sitting – but note that this only means that you are actually in the process of sitting; as in,
        you are currently bending your knees getting ready to sit.<br />
        “저는 앉고 있다” is grammatically correct, but you need to ask yourself when you would ever say this.</p>
      <p>What you want to say, is “I am (in the state of) sitting”… as in, your butt is on the floor/on a chair, etc..
        If you want to do this, you have to add ~아/어 있다 to these verbs instead of ~고 있다. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-25.mp3">나는 앉아 있어</a> = I’m
        sitting<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-26.mp3">나는 학교 옆에 서 있어</a> = I’m
        standing next to the school<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-27.mp3">나는 침대에 누워 있어</a> = I’m
        lying in bed
      </p>
      <p>In theory, this is the same concept that you used when you added ~아/어 있다 to “state” like words in <a
          title="Lesson 14: Korean Passive Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-14-korean-passive-verbs/">Lesson
          14</a>. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-28.mp3">컴퓨터가 켜져 있어요</a> = The
        computer is (in the state of) on<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-29.mp3">TV가 꺼져 있어요</a> = The TV is
        (in the state of) off<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-30.mp3">문이 잠겨 있어요</a> = The door
        is (in the state of) locked
      </p>
      <p>One more time, for good measure:</p>
      <p>나는 서고 있다 = This means that you are currently in the <em>process</em> of standing up – which probably wouldn’t
        be said… especially since Korean people have a specific word for “getting up” – 일어나다.<br />
        나는 서 있다 = This means that you are in the state of standing (probably what you want to say in almost every
        situation)</p>
      <p>Another common word that this is used with is 살다. Earlier in this lesson, you learned how you can use ~고 있다
        with 살다. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-14.mp3">저는 한국에서 살고 있어요</a> = I
        live in Korea</p>
      <p>By adding “~아/어 있다” to 살다, you can create the meaning of “in the state of living” (as in, the opposite of dead.
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-17.mp3">그 돼지는 살아 있어요</a> = That
        pig is living (alive)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-18.mp3">그 소는 살아 있지 않아요</a> = That
        cow isn’t living (alive)
      </p>
      <h3><a name="pp5"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using ~</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">고</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"> 있다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> with
          Adjectives</span><br />
        You cannot attach ~고 있다 to adjectives. Adjectives, by their nature, are not able to &#8220;progress&#8221; as
        verbs do. This is the same as in English. For example:</p>
      <p>저는 행복해요 = I am happy – this is okay.<br />
        저는 행복하고 있어요 – I am… being happy? Doesn’t make any sense.</p>
      <p>In English, you can say I am <em>getting </em>happy. The next section will teach you how to do that.</p>
      <h3><a name="a"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adjective + ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">아</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">어지다</span></p>
      <p>Another powerful grammatical form in Korean is adding ~아/어지다 to the stem of an adjective. This changes the
        meaning of an adjective from “be (adjective)” to “get/become (adjective).” For example:</p>
      <p>행복하다 = to be happy<br />
        행복해지다 = to get/become happy</p>
      <p>춥다 = to be cold<br />
        추워지다 = to get cold</p>
      <p>비싸다 = to be expensive<br />
        비싸지다 = to get expensive</p>
      <p>크다 = to be big<br />
        커지다 = to get/become big</p>
      <p>따뜻하다 = to be warm<br />
        따뜻해지다 = to get warm</p>
      <p>You can technically use these adjectives in the present tense, but just like with verbs, you only ever really
        use the present tense conjugation to indicate common truths or to indicate the frequency of something happening.
        For example, you would rarely ever say:</p>
      <p>I eat rice<br />
        But you might be more inclined to say:<br />
        I eat rice everyday</p>
      <p>Same thing here:</p>
      <p>날씨가 추워져 = The weather gets cold<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-19.mp3">날씨가 매일 밤에 추워져요</a> = The
        weather gets cold every night
      </p>
      <p>It is more natural to use these types of words in sentences in the past/future tense:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-34.mp3">날씨는 주말에 추워졌어</a> = The
        weather got cold over the weekend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-20.mp3">기름 값은 비싸졌어요</a> = The
        price of oil got expensive<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-21.mp3">그 사람은 밥을 먹고 나서 행복해졌어요</a>
        = That person ate, and then became happy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-22.mp3">우리 강아지는 지난 1년 동안 많이
          커졌어요</a> = Our puppy got a lot bigger in the last year<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-23.mp3">저는 군대에 갔고 똑똑해졌어요</a> = I
        went to the army and got smart<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-24.mp3">대학교 수업은 내년에 어려워질 거예요</a>

      </p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0K0cNgI6Ny0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Want to see how ~아/어지다 would
          be used in a Korean street sign? Watch me breakdown the usage in a YouTube video.</a></p>
      <p>When ~아/어지다 is added to an adjective, the entire construction is a verb. In practice, this is rarely an issue
        because most times the conjugation of an adjective and a verb is the same. However, there are some conjugation
        patterns (which you learned about in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lessons 5</a> and <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">6</a>) that are different
        depending on if the word is an adjective or verb. For example, when conjugating these using the “diary form,” it
        should be conjugated as:</p>
      <p>날씨가 매일 밤에 추워진다 = The weather gets cold every night, instead of:<br />
        날씨가 매일 밤에 추워지다 = The weather gets cold every night</p>
      <p>Keep this on your mind when you reach <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lessons
          26 – 30</a>, where I introduce the ~는 것 principle. In those lessons, you will learn about another grammatical
        principle that is treated differently depending on if it is added to verbs or adjectives. It also allows
        grammatical principles that otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be able to be attached to adjectives to be attached to this
        new &#8220;verb&#8221; word.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned earlier, you cannot attach ~고 있다 to an adjective. However, by attaching ~아/어지다 to an adjective,
        you can indicate that something &#8220;becomes&#8221; an adjective. It is then possible to attach ~고 있다 to an
        adjective that has ~아/어지다 already attached. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-40.mp3">저의 여자 친구는 예뻐지고 있어요</a> =
        My girlfriend is getting pretty<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-41.mp3">집 값은 비싸지고 있어</a> = House
        prices are getting expensive<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-18-25.mp3">피부가 부드러워지고 있어요</a> = My
        skin is getting soft
      </p>
      <p>In the previous lesson, you learned that you cannot add ~고 싶다 to an adjective. By attaching ~아/어지다, you can
        indicate that something &#8220;becomes&#8221; an adjective. It is then possible to attach ~고 싶다 to an adjective
        as with ~고 있다. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-43.mp3">나는 행복해지고 싶어</a> = I want
        to become happy (I want to be happy)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson18-44.mp3">나는 예뻐지고 싶어</a> = I want to
        become pretty (I want to be pretty)
      </p>
      <p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
