        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          처음에 = at first<br />
          처음부터 = from the beginning<br />
          처음부터 끝까지 = from start to finish<br />
          오랜만에 처음으로 = for the first time in a long time</p>
        <p>Notes: This can be used in sentences when you are talking about the first time something is being done. Or it
          can be used as an adverb to have the meaning “in the beginning”</p>
        <p>See <a href="#ftime">below in this lesson</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          저는 <strong>처음에</strong> 우리 학교가 좋지 않았어요 = I didn’t like our school at <strong>first<br />
          </strong>저는 어제 공항에 <strong>처음</strong> 갔어요 = Yesterday, I went to the airport for the <strong>first</strong>
          <strong>time<br />

        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          마지막 날 = the last day<br />
          마지막 게임 = the last game<br />
          마지막으로 = lastly</p>
        <p>Notes: There are two similar but different meanings for the word “last” in English. 마지막 is used for only ONE
          of those meanings. 마지막 is used to talk about something that is the last thing in the end of sequence &#8211;
          as in “first meal… second meal… third meal… fourth meal… last meal.” It is NOT used to talk about something in
          the past, as in “last night I went to bed late.” See bellow in this lesson for more information.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          이 수업은 우리의 <strong>마지막</strong> 수업이에요 = This is our <strong>last</strong> class<br />
          이것은 저의 <strong>마지막</strong> 기회이다 = This is my <strong>last</strong> chance<br />
          저는 <strong>마지막</strong> 수업을 안 들었어요 = I didn’t attend the <strong>last</strong> class<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-50.mp3">저는 <strong>마지막</strong>
            것을 안 봤어요</a> = I didn&#8217;t see the <strong>last</strong> thing<br />
          우리는 결국 <strong>마지막</strong> 경기에서 졌어요 = We ended up losing in the <strong>last</strong> game<br />
          교수님은 <strong>마지막</strong> 수업이 끝나고 학생들을 위해 식사를 샀어요 = The professor bought a meal for the students after the
          <strong>last</strong> class

      <div id="target-id6783cce67d33e" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: This can be added as a counter after a number to mean
          1<sup>st</sup>/2<sup>nd</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup>/etc.</p>
        <p>When saying “first”, “첫” replaces “한”.</p>
        <p>저는 첫 번째 차를 싫어했어요 = I didn’t like that first car</p>
        <p>After “first,” you can use the regular Korean numbers. Just like with counters, the numbers 2 – 4 change when
          번째 follows. For example:<br />
          저는 두 번째 남자를 골랐어요 = I chose the second man</p>
        <p>After the number four, the words don’t change when adding 번째. For example:<br />
          이 수업은 오늘 저의 열 번째 수업입니다 = This is my tenth class today</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          저는 열 <strong>번째로 도착한</strong> 사람이었어요 = I was the 10<strong><sup>th</sup></strong> person to arrive

        <p>Notes: Can be shortened to “첫째” in some situations, usually when the following word is a counter or
          somebody’s children. For example:<br />
          첫째 아들 = first son<br />
          첫째 주 = first week</p>

          둘째 아들 = second daughter<br />
          둘째 날 = second day</p>

      <div id="target-id6783cce67d384" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: Counters are used in Korean to count various things. Different counters are used for things like
          people, books, animals, etc. “개” is the general counter that can be used to count most things that don’t have
          a specific counter (or if you don’t know the specific counter-word for something). See <a href="#count">below
            in this lesson</a> for more information.</p>
        <p title="저는 열 번째로 도착한 사람이었어요 = I was the 10th person to arrive">Example:<br />

      <div id="target-id6783cce67d39a" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: This can be used to indicate the amount of times something is done. In the end, it acts as an adverb
          and particles are not usually attached to it.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 한국에 5<strong>번</strong> 갔어요 = I went to Korea 5 <strong>times<br />

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Numbers</span></p>
      <p>Korean numbers are actually very easy once you get the hang of them. But, because they are so different from
        English numbers, it is often hard for English speakers to fully understand them at first.<br />
        First thing you need to know, there are two sets of numbers in Korean: The pure Korean numbers and the numbers
        derived from Chinese (called Sino-Korean numbers). Let’s look at the Sino-Korean numbers first, because they are
        easier:</p>
      <h3><a name="skn"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sino-Korean Numbers</span></p>
      <p>These are the Sino-Korean numbers as provided earlier:</p>
      <p>일 = one<br />
        이 = two<br />
        삼 = three<br />
        사 = four<br />
        오 = five<br />
        육 = six<br />
        칠 = seven<br />
        팔 = eight<br />
        구 = nine<br />
        십 = ten<br />
        백 = one hundred<br />
        천 = one thousand<br />
        만 = ten thousand</p>
      <p>With only those numbers, you can create any number from 1 – 10 million. All you need to do is put them
        together:</p>
      <p>일 = one (1)<br />
        십 = ten (10)<br />
        십일 = eleven (10 + 1)<br />
        이십 = twenty (2 x 10)<br />
        이십일 = twenty one (2 x 10 + 1)<br />
        이십이 = twenty two (2 x 10 + 2)<br />
        백 = one hundred (100)<br />
        백일 = one hundred and one (100 + 1)<br />
        백이 = one hundred and two (100 + 2)<br />
        백구십 = one hundred and ninety (100 + 90)<br />
        구백 = nine hundred (9 x 100)<br />
        천 = one thousand (1000)<br />
        천구백 = one thousand nine hundred (1000 + 9 x 100)<br />
        오천 = five thousand (5 x 1000)<br />
        오천육백 = five thousand six hundred (5 x 1000 + 6 x 100)<br />
        만 = ten thousand<br />
        십만 = one hundred thousand<br />
        백만 = one million<br />
        천만 = ten million</p>
      <p>The Sino-Korean numbers are used in limited situations. As each of these are taught throughout the upcoming
        lessons, you will slowly learn when to use the Sino-Korean numbers over the Korean numbers. For now, don’t worry
        about memorizing when they should be used, as it will come naturally.</p>
      <p>&#8211; When counting/dealing with money<br />
        &#8211; When measuring<br />
        &#8211; When doing math<br />
        &#8211; In phone-numbers<br />
        &#8211; When talking about/counting time in any way except the hour<br />
        &#8211; The names of each month<br />
        &#8211; Counting months (there is another way to count months using pure Korean numbers)</p>
      <h3><a name="pkn"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pure Korean Numbers</span></p>
      <p>These are the pure Korean numbers as provided earlier:<br />
        하나 = one<br />
        둘 = two<br />
        셋 = three<br />
        넷 = four<br />
        다섯 = five<br />
        여섯 = six<br />
        일곱 = seven<br />
        여덟 = eight<br />
        아홉 = nine<br />
        열 = ten<br />
        스물 = twenty<br />
        서른 = thirty<br />
        마흔 = forty<br />
        쉰 = fifty</p>
      <p>Creating numbers 11-19, 21-29, 31-39 (etc..) is easy, and is done like this:</p>
      <p>11: 열하나 (10 + 1)<br />
        12: 열둘 (10 + 2)<br />
        21: 스물하나 (20 + 1)<br />
        59: 쉰아홉 (50 + 9)</p>
      <p><em>Notice that there are no spaces between the words representing numbers for both the Sino-Korean and pure
          Korean numbers. I discuss this in a <a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-6/lessons-126-133/lesson130/">much more difficult lesson</a>
          that covers how numbers greater than 10,000 are used. For now, it is more important to focus on how to use
          simple numbers in sentences.</em></p>
      <p>After 60, regardless of what you are doing, pure Korean numbers are rarely used. I was talking to my wife about
        this once, and she said that she didn’t think there was even a pure Korean number for 60. I told her “yes, there
        is: 예순.” To which she replied “Oh yeah, I forgot.” When you get that high (even as high as 40-50) it is not
        uncommon to use the Sino-Korean numbers instead.</p>
      <p>The pure Korean numbers are used when:</p>
      <p>&#8211; You are counting things/people/actions<br />
        &#8211; Talking about the hour in time<br />
        &#8211; Sometimes used when talking about months.</p>
      <p>Again, don’t worry about memorizing each of those yet. Whenever I talk about numbers, I will tell you which set
        you are expected to use.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using Numbers</span></p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counters</span></p>
      <p>When counting anything in Korean, you need to use the pure Korean numbers. In addition, one thing that is very
        hard for English speakers to wrap their head around is that, when counting most things in Korean, you need to
        also include a ‘counter.’ The most common counters are:</p>
      <p>개 = counter for things<br />
        명 = counter for people<br />
        번 = counter for behaviors/actions</p>
      <p>There are many more counters, but if you can’t remember the specific counter of something, you can usually
        substitute &#8220;개&#8221; (the counter for &#8220;thing&#8221;) instead. You will learn the more difficult
        counters as you progress through future lessons. For now, the goal is to get you accustomed to using these three
        simple counters.</p>
      <p>When counting in English, we usually don&#8217;t use counters. Rather we just say: &#8220;two people,&#8221; as
        in:</p>
      <p>I met two people</p>
      <p>But some things in English require the use of these counters. For example, you could not say “I bought two
        films” (referring to the film in a camera, not a ‘movie’). Instead, you have to say “I bought two <strong>rolls
        </strong>of film.” The word roll in that sentence is a counter, and is similar to the counters in Korean. The
        main difference is that counters are used to count almost everything in Korean.</p>
      <p>The words 1, 2, 3, 4 and 20 change when adding a counter:</p>
      <p>1 = 하나 -&gt; 한<br />
        2 = 둘 -&gt; 두<br />
        3 = 셋 -&gt; 세<br />
        4 = 넷 -&gt; 네<br />
        20 = 스물 -&gt; 스무</p>
      <p>Place a number, followed by a counter, after a noun to indicate how many of that thing there are. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-1.mp3">사람 두 명</a> = 2
        people<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-3.mp3">사람 한 명</a> = 1 person<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-5.mp3">펜 다섯 개</a> = 5 pens<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-7.mp3">펜 마흔네 개</a> = 44 pens
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p><em>It is also possible to put the number-counter combination <span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the noun that is being counted. However, the method shown
          immediately above is much more common. When placed before the noun, &#8220;~의&#8221; is added to the counter,
          for example:</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-2.mp3">두 명의 사람</a> = 2
        people<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-4.mp3">한 명의 사람</a> = 1
        person<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-6.mp3">다섯 개의 펜</a> = 5 pens<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-8.mp3">마흔네 개의 펜</a> = 44 pens
      </p>
      <p><em>The purpose and function of ~</em>의<em> in this type of construction is discussed in <a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-23/">Lesson 23</a>. As I said, it
          is usually less common to count using this method, so for now, don&#8217;t worry about this grammar. I simply
          want you to know that it can be done. Pay more attention to the &#8220;</em>사람 두 명<em>&#8221; form instead of
          the &#8220;</em>두 명의 사람<em>&#8221; form. </em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>When writing out the word instead of using the numeral (for example, writing “한” instead of “1”) the correct
        form is to have a space between the written number and the counter. For example:</p>
      <p>한 개 instead of 한개<br />
        두 번 instead of 두번<br />
        세 명 instead of 세명</p>
      <p>When the Korean numbers are used (i.e. when counting things or actions), the word is more typically used than
        the numeral. In our lessons, you will usually see the Korean word written out when a counter is used.</p>
      <p>In other situations where Sino-Korean numbers are used, there is no difference if you use the Sino-Korean
        numeral or the word. I will come back to this in the <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-11/">next lesson</a> when you learn
        applications for Sino-Korean numbers.</p>
      <p>These nouns that we have counted can now become the object of a sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-1.mp3">나는 펜 네 개를 샀어</a> =
        I bought four pens<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-2.mp3">나는 햄버거 두 개를 먹었어</a>

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><em>The number-counter combination could also be placed <span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">before</span> the noun, as we discussed earlier:<br />

      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>Although the placement of the particles is important for your initial understanding of Korean grammar,
        eventually, you will become more comfortable with omitting particles altogether. Omitting particles is not
        something I recommend for a beginner because it is very important that you understand how to use them perfectly
        for more complex sentences. Nonetheless, most often in speech, particles in this situation are often omitted.
        For example, you might hear something like this:</p>
      <p>나는 펜 네 개 샀어 = I bought 4 pens</p>
      <p>In this structure, it is also possible to put the particle on the noun instead of the counter, for example:</p>
      <p>나는 펜을 네 개 샀어 = I bought 4 pens</p>
      <p>Try not to worry about this too much at this stage, as the following three sentences would sound perfect to
        Korean people:</p>
      <p>나는 펜 네 개 샀어<br />
        나는 펜을 네 개 샀어<br />
        나는 펜 네 개를 샀어</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>Here are some more examples of counters in use:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-4.mp3">그 사람은 차 네 대가
          있어요</a> = That person has four cars<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-5.mp3">저는 우유 두 잔을 샀어요</a> =
        I bought two glasses of milk<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-6.mp3">저는 땅콩 두 개를 먹었어요</a>
        = I ate two peanuts
      </p>
      <h3><a name="zero"></a></h3>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zero</span></p>
      <p>I figure since I am talking about numbers, I should mention something about how/when the number zero is used.
        Just like other numbers, there are two ways to say “zero” in Korea. However, unlike other numbers, both ways of
        saying “zero” are of Chinese origin.</p>
      <p>영, which is (from what I understand), the way Chinese people say “zero”<br />
        공, which is sort of like the meaning of “nothing”</p>
      <p>That isn’t really very important, but what is important is knowing which word to use in which situation.</p>
      <p>You should use “영” when talking about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Points that can be given or taken away, like in a game. For example, when saying the score “2 – 0”, you
          would say “이 대 영”. Another example would be if you are in a quiz show, and you ask your friend how many points
          she has, she could say “영점”</li>
        <li>The temperature “zero”</li>
        <li>When using numbers in math (which, if you’re just learning Korean now, you probably won’t do for a long
          time)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You should use “공” when talking about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phone numbers. For example, when saying “010 – 5555 – 5555”, all the zeros should be read as “공.” If you
          don’t live in Korea, you probably won’t know this, but “010” is the typical area code for a cell phone (in
          Seoul, at least). Therefore, when giving your phone number, you usually start out by saying “공-일-공”.</li>
      </ul>

          &#8211; Counter of Behavior or Action</span></p>
      <p>번 is a common counter that counts behavior or actions, and is not directly counted with a noun in a sentence.
        Putting a number before “번” creates an adverb that tells you how many times something was done. It is an adverb,
        so 를/을 is usually not attached to it.</p>

      <p>This is fairly simple to use, but you will continue to learn about this word in the next lesson when you learn
        how to say “this time,” “next time,” and “last time.”</p>
      <h3><a name="ktime"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Telling Korean Time</span></p>
      <p>There are so many different ways to talk about time (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years,
        etc…). You will learn more about how to indicate when you did/do/will do something using these ‘time’ words in
        the <a title="Lesson 11: 동안, Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-11/">next lesson</a>. In this lesson,
        however, you will learn about telling time, as in the time on a clock.</p>
      <p>When talking about the hour, as in ‘2 o’clock’ all you need to do is put 시 after a number:</p>
      <p>2시 = 2:00 (2 o’clock)</p>
      <p>When talking about the minute, add 분 after the number:</p>
      <p>2시 30분 = 2:30</p>
      <p>The pure Korean numbers are used when saying the hour number, whereas the Sino-Korean numbers are used when
        saying the minute number. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-23.mp3">2시 30분</a> = 2:30,
        or<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-23.mp3">두 시 삼십 분</a> = Two thirty
      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the lesson I said that when a pure Korean number is used with a counter, it is more commonly written
        out instead of using the numeral. In this case, &#8220;시&#8221; could be seen as a counter as we are counting
        &#8220;hours.&#8221; However, writing the numeral or the word is equally as common and acceptable when referring
        to the time. In my case, I much prefer to use the numeral instead of the word.</p>
      <p>To indicate the minute, Sino-Korean numbers are used and (just like all times when Sino-Korean numbers are
        used) there is no difference if you use the numeral or the word. I prefer to use the numeral in these cases.</p>
      <p>The spacing of these also needs to be discussed. As I mentioned earlier, when a written number is placed before
        a counter, there should be a space between the number and the counter. This is true for the number before
        &#8220;분&#8221; as well. For example, if you were writing the words out:</p>
      <p>두 시 should be written instead of 두시<br />
        삼십 분 should be written instead of 삼십분</p>
      <p>However, when using the numeral, it is acceptable to omit the space and attach the numeral directly with the
        following counter. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-23.mp3">2시 30분</a></p>
      <p>Officially, there should be a space. However, most people do not include a space and it is also seen as correct
        to omit it. Other examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-24.mp3">3시 10분</a> = 3:10<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-24.mp3">세 시 십 분</a> = Three ten
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-25.mp3">12시 50분</a> = 12:50<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-25.mp3">열두 시 오십 분</a> = Twelve
        fifty
      </p>
      <p><em>You will see more examples of this in the next lesson when you learn more applications of numbers
          (specifically Sino-Korean numbers). If you can&#8217;t get it into your brain yet, it will be easier when you
          see more examples in the next lesson.</em></p>
      <p>These times can now go in a sentence as usual by adding 에 to indicate a time:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-26.mp3">나는 5시에 먹을 거야</a> = I will
        eat at 5:00<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-2.mp3">나는 2시 30분에 왔어</a> = I came
        at 2:30<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-9.mp3">우리는 야구를 1시에 할 거예요
        </a>= We will play baseball at 1:00<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-s1.mp3">우리는 7시 20분에 시작할 거예요</a> =
        We will start at 7:20
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="age"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age</span></p>
      <p>When indicating how old a person is, you should use pure Korean numbers along with the word “살” which is a
        counter for ages. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-s2.mp3">저는 열 살이에요</a> = I am ten
        years old<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-s3.mp3">저의 여자 친구는 스물여섯 살이에요</a> =
        My girlfriend is twenty six years old
      </p>
      <p>It would sound weird to use the Sino-Korean numbers to indicate the age of somebody who is under thirty.
        However, after thirty, it is not uncommon to use the Sino-Korean numbers instead of the pure Korean numbers. The
        older the age, the more likely you will hear the Sino-Korean number used instead of the pure Korean number.
        After 50, you are most likely to exclusively hear the Sino-Korean numbers.</p>
      <p>You haven’t learned how to ask questions yet, so it is difficult for me to explain how to ask about a person’s
        age. You will understand the following sentence better once you are confident with the content introduced in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">Lessons
          21</a> and <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-22/">22</a>.
        Nonetheless, it would be good to memorize this sentence because of how common of a question it is:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-s4.mp3">몇 살이에요?</a> = How old
        are you?</p>
      <h3><a name="first"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">번째: </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">First, Second, Third, etc&#8230;</span></p>
      <p>번째 can be used after a number like a counter to mean first/second/third/etc. When saying “first”, “첫” replaces
        “한”.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">첫 번째 = first</span><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-33.mp3">저의 첫 번째 친구는 착했어요</a> = My
        first friend was nice<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-10.mp3">저는 첫 번째 차를
          싫어했어요</a> = I didn’t like that first car<br />
        <em>If you think that is confusing, explain how ‘one’ gets changed to ‘first,’ ‘two’ gets changed to ‘second’
          and ‘three’ gets changed to ‘third.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>After &#8220;first,&#8221; you can use the regular Korean numbers. Just like with counters, the numbers 2 – 4
        change when 번째 follows. For example:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">두 번째 = second</span><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-35.mp3">그 두 번째 선생님은 똑똑했어요</a> =
        That second teacher was smart<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-11.mp3">저는 두 번째 남자를
          골랐어요</a> = I chose the second man
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">세 번째 = third</span><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-12.mp3">이 여권은 저의 세 번째
          여권이에요</a> = This passport is my third passport<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-13.mp3">저는 세 번째 문을 열었어요</a>
        = I opened the third door
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">네 번째 = fourth</span><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-14.mp3">저는 네 번째 사람이었어요</a>
        = I was the fourth person<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-15.mp3">이 아이는 저의 네 번째
          아들이에요</a> = This person is my fourth son
      </p>
      <p>After the number four, the words don’t change when adding 번째. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-16.mp3">이 수업은 오늘 저의 열 번째
          수업입니다</a> = This is my tenth class today<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-17.mp3">저는 백 번째 페이지를
          읽었어요</a> = I read the 100<sup>th</sup> page
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes you might see these numbers + counters used in the following way:</p>
      <p>첫 번째 = 첫째 = first<br />
        두 번째 = 둘째 = second<br />
        세 번째 = 셋째 = third<br />
        네 번째 = 넷째 = fourth<br />
        etc.…</p>
      <p><a href="https://youtu.be/Cej5MSedaxQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a video explaining a
          Korean sign that uses this idea of shortening 첫 번째 to 첫째</a>.</p>
      <p>These shortened forms can’t be used in as many situations as their longer counterparts. The most common
        situation where these are used is when talking about your first/second/third/etc. children. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-18.mp3">우리 둘째 아들은
          고등학생이에요</a> = Our second son is a high school student<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-19.mp3">우리 셋째 아이는 야구를
          좋아해요</a> = Our third child likes baseball<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-20.mp3">이 아이는 우리 첫째
          아들이에요</a> = This (child) is our first son
      </p>
      <p>In these cases, it is common to just refer to the child as “one’s first” or “one’s second.” We often do the
        same thing in English. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-21.mp3">우리 둘째는 고등학생이에요</a>
        = Our second (child) is a high school student<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-22.mp3">우리 셋째는 야구를 좋아해요</a>
        = Our third (child) likes baseball<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-23.mp3">이 아이는 우리 첫째예요</a> =
        This (child) is our first (child)
      </p>
      <p>However, as I mentioned, it would be unnatural to use these words in sentences like this:</p>
      <p>저는 셋째 문을 열었어요 (very understandable, but awkward)<br />
        저는 넷째 사람이었어요 (very understandable, but awkward)</p>
      <p>Another place you will see words like 첫째 and 둘째 is when making lists about things that need to be done, and the
        speaker/writer is indicating “Firstly… and then secondly…” For example:</p>
      <p>첫째, 저는 야채를 많이 먹겠습니다 = First, I will eat a lot of vegetables<br />
        둘째, 저는 매일 운동하겠습니다 = Second, I will exercise everyday</p>
      <p><em>I didn&#8217;t make audio recordings for the above sentences because I feel they would more likely be
          written than spoken.</em></p>
      <p>Another useful word is 마지막 which often translates to ‘last.’ It is often confusing for English speakers to
        understand the usage of 마지막 at first because the word “last” has more than one usage in English. 마지막 is used to
        refer to the <em>final </em>(last) thing at the end of sequence… as in “first meal… second meal… third meal…
        fourth meal… final (last) meal.” It is not used to refer to a “previous” thing. Notice the difference between
        these two usages of “last night”:</p>
      <p>Last night (the previous night) I went to the movies<br />
        The last night (the final night) of our trip was the best</p>
      <p>The second example would be where you could use 마지막, because you are referring to the <em>final </em>(last)
        night of a sequence of nights on a trip. In the first example, you are talking about the previous night. I will
        introduce how you can refer to a “previous” thing in the next lesson where I introduce 지난.</p>
      <p>Here are some examples of 마지막 in use:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-49.mp3">이것은 저의 마지막 수업이에요</a> =
        This is my last class<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-50.mp3">저는 마지막 것을 안 봤어요</a> = I
        didn’t see the last thing (I didn’t see that last one)
      </p>
      <p>In these examples, 마지막 is being used as a descriptive word, even though it is not an adjective in its original
        form (it is not an adjective because it does not end in 다, and cannot be conjugated). Words can be used this way
        in English as well. The word “face” is a noun. But in the sentence “I put on face paint,” the word “face”
        describes the type of paint you used. Similarly, you could say “that is a computer room,” where the word
        “computer” is describing the room.</p>
      <h3><a name="ftime"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">처음</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">–
          First Time</span></p>
      <p>처음 is a very complex word that can be used in many situations. I have been studying Korean for years and I
        still don’t know how to use it perfectly in all situations. It can be used in sentences when you are talking
        about the first time something is being done. It can be used as a noun or an adverb, depending on the situation
        (which adds to it’s complexity). The two most common situations are:</p>
      <p>1) 처음에 … (at first/in the beginning)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-51.mp3">처음에 그 여자를 싫어했어요</a> = I
        didn’t like that girl at first<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-24.mp3">저는 처음에 체육 수업을
          싫어했어요</a> = At first I didn’t like PE class
      </p>
      <p>2) Put in a sentence as an adverb to indicate this is the first time something has happened:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-53.mp3">저는 어제 선생님을 처음 만났어요</a> = I
        met my teacher for the first time yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson10-54.mp3">저는 내일 한국에 처음 갈 것입니다</a> =
        I will go to Korea for the first time tomorrow
