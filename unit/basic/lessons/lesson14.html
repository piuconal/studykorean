      <div id="target-id6783cf214d556" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          냄새가 나다 = for something a smell to come out<br />
          냄새가 지독하다 = for something to smell terrible<br />
          냄새를 맡다 = to smell (verb) a smell (noun)<br />
          냄새를 맡아봐 = try smelling this</p>
        <p>Notes: It is hard for an English speaker to understand this word. “냄새” is a noun that means “smell.” If you
          want to say that something is smellY (adjective), you need to use the verb 나다, which is very confusing. 나다
          acts as a passive verb which is introduced in Lesson 14.</p>
        <p>For a positive/good smell, the word “향” is more commonly used.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          그 방에서 <strong>냄새</strong>가 나요 = That room is smelly (A <strong>smell</strong> is coming out of that
          room)<br />

          and depend heavily on the situation. When used by itself, it usually translates to “pay” or to “submit” For

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>This lesson contains a lot of boring, confusing grammar. I am warning you now.</p>
      <p>If you looked at the vocabulary list of this lesson before reading this, you may have noticed something strange
        with some of the words. A lot of the words look very similar to each other. The reason for this is because today
        you will learn about passive verbs in Korean. Though I studied passive verbs very early in my studies, it is
        something that actually took me a year to fully grasp – and not because it is incredibly difficult, but rather
        that I never received any proper instruction regarding passive verbs.</p>
      <p>I don’t really like explaining English grammar too much in my lessons. However, an understanding of what
        passive verbs are and how they are used in English sentences will help you with your understanding of their
        equivalent Korean sentences.</p>
      <p>An active verb is used when a subject does an action. For example:</p>
      <p><em>In the examples below, the subject is “I”</em></p>
      <p>I eat<br />
        I learn<br />
        I open</p>
      <p>Active verbs often act on an object. For example:</p>
      <p><em>The word “object” here refers to the part of speech that a verb can act on. Sometimes learners get confused
          and think that an object means “a thing,” for example; “a pencil” or “a door.” In theory, any noun can be an
          object of a sentence – including people or abstract ideas that are not considered “objects” in the literal
          (non-language) sense. For example, the objects are underlined in the following sentence</em><em>s:</em></p>
      <p><em>I love <u>my father<br />
          </u>He wants <u>respect</u></em></p>
      <p>I eat rice<br />
        I learn Korean<br />
        I open the door</p>
      <p>Some active verbs by their nature cannot act on an object. For example, the active verbs are underlined in the
        examples below:</p>
      <p>I <u>went</u> to the park<br />
        I <u>arrived</u> at the park</p>
      <p><em>“The park” in the above examples are not objects. The verb is not acting on that part of speech. They just
          indicate places within the sentence.</em></p>
      <p>In all of the above examples, regardless of if there is an object in the sentence or not, the subject performs
        the action. These are all active sentences.</p>
      <p>Passive sentences indicate that an action is performed on the subject. For example:</p>
      <p>I was kicked<br />
        The door was opened<br />
        The hamburger was eaten</p>
      <p>In English, passive verbs feel like adjectives because their sentence structures are similar. For example:</p>
      <p>I was handsome<br />
        The door was big<br />
        The hamburger was delicious</p>
      <p>Let’s look at an active verb and passive verb being used in similar sentences:</p>
      <p>1) I opened the door<br />
        2) The door was opened</p>
      <p>In the first example “I” am the subject and I performed the action (opening) on the object (the door).<br />
        In the second example, “the door” is the subject and the action (opening) was performed on it.</p>
      <p>Below are some more active-passive pairs to help you see how they differ from one-another:</p>
      <p><em>All of the examples below are in the present tense. In the present tense, these passive sentences (just
          like most plain sentences used in the present tense) sound unnatural. For example, I would never say “I turn
          the computer on.” However, I am using the present tense simply because this is the basic “raw” form of the
          sentence. They could be applied to the past, the future, or other complicated things could be applied to
          them.</em></p>
      <p>I turn the computer on<br />
        The computer is turned on</p>
      <p>I lock the door<br />
        The door is locked</p>
      <p>I respect my friend<br />
        My friend is respected</p>
      <p>I cooked the rice<br />
        The rice is cooked</p>
      <p>Passive verbs (like adjectives) cannot act on an object. For example:</p>
      <p>I opened the door (active verb) – correct<br />
        The door was opened me (passive verb) &#8211; incorrect<br />
        The door was big me (adjective) – incorrect</p>
      <p>However, sentences with passive verbs can include more information to indicate by whom (or by what) the action
        was performed. For example:</p>
      <p>The door was opened by <u>me</u><br />
        The door was opened by <u>the wind</u><br />
        The door was opened by <u>the guard</u></p>
      <p>I’ll do the same with all of the passive sentences that I showed you earlier:</p>
      <p>The computer was turned on by me<br />
        The door was locked by the teacher<br />
        My friend is respected by many people<br />
        The rice was cooked by my mother</p>
      <p>Because passive verbs cannot act on an object, you will never see ~을/를 in a sentence predicated by a passive
        verb in Korean. Remember, ~을/를 is used to mark objects in Korean sentences – and therefore their usage is
        impossible with passive verbs.</p>
      <p>This is probably the most important paragraph in the entire lesson; it is usually unnatural to use passive
        verbs in Korean. In almost every situation, it is more natural to use the active form of a verb. For example,
        instead of saying “the house is built” it is more natural to say “somebody built the house” (which implies that
        the house is now built).</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, understanding how passive verbs are used in Korean is crucial to your development.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to make a passive sentence in Korean. In this lesson, we will look at the different ways
        this can be done.</p>
      <p>It is also important to remember that passive verbs are <strong><em>verbs</em></strong> – not adjectives.
        Korean learners often think they are adjectives because they look, sound and feel similar to adjectives and they
        never act on objects. Always remember that passive verbs are verbs. This is important because you <u>must
          conjugate them as verbs</u> and not as adjectives.</p>
      <p>Alright, let’s get started.</p>

      <h3><a name="kpv1"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Passive Verbs – </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">되다</span></p>
      <p>I’ve told you twice before that verbs ending in 하다 can usually be separated from 하다 to create a noun form of
        that verb. 하다 then has the meaning of “do”:</p>
      <p>나는 일했어 = I worked<br />
        which has the same meaning of:<br />
        나는 일을 했어 = I did work/I worked</p>
      <p>When dealing with 하다 verbs, most of the time you can simply exchange 하다 with 되다, to make that verb passive. For
        example:</p>
      <p>포함하다 = to include<br />
        포함되다 = to be included</p>
      <p>제공하다 = to provide<br />
        제공되다 = to be provided</p>
      <p>대체하다 = to replace<br />
        대체되다 = to be replaced</p>
      <p>You can use passive verbs to create sentences that have similar meaning to sentences with each respective
        active verb. Structurally the sentences will be different however, because the passive version of a verb cannot
        act on an object. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1.mp3">이 값은 세금을 포함해요</a> = This price
        includes tax<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-1.mp3">세금은 포함돼요</a> = The tax is included
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-1.mp3">저는 점심을 준비했어요</a> = I
        prepared (the) lunch<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-2.mp3">점심이 준비되었어요</a> = (The)
        lunch was prepared
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/5.mp3">회사는 기계를 대체했어</a> = The company
        replaced the machine<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6.mp3">기계는 대체되었어</a> = The machine was
        replaced
      </p>
      <p><em>Adding </em>어<em> to </em>되<em> creates either </em>되어<em> or </em>돼<em> with no difference in meaning.
          (For example, </em>되다<em> in the present tense can either be 돼 or 되어. In the past tense, it can either be
        </em>되었다<em> or </em>됐다.</p>
      <p>Often the speaker wants to indicate <em>by whom/what</em> the lunch was prepared, or by<em> whom/what </em>the
        machine was replaced. For example:</p>
      <p>&#8211; The lunch was prepared <em>by the school<br />
        </em>&#8211; The machine was replaced <em>by the company</em></p>
      <p>In the examples above, although we are still using a passive verb, information about how the passive verb
        occurred is given. This is an example of when it is much more common to use the active form over the passive
        form in Korean. In Korean (and most likely in English as well), it would be much more natural to say &#8220;I
        prepared the lunch&#8221; instead of &#8220;The lunch was prepared by me.&#8221; Nonetheless, the grammar within
        these sentences is important, so I need to continue teaching it to you here.</p>
      <p>In order to create these sentences, you need to remember that sentences with a predicating passive verb can NOT
        have an object – which means that you CANNOT attach ~를/을 to “the school” or “the company.” For example, the
        sentence below would be ridiculous and probably wouldn&#8217;t be understood at all:</p>
      <p>점심이 학교를 준비되었어요</p>
      <p>In these types of sentences, in order to indicate how/by which means the passive verb occurs, you need to use
        different particles. If this part of a sentence is a person, it is acceptable to attach the particle
        &#8220;에게&#8221; to the noun. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/7-1.mp3">그것은 이해되었어</a> = It was
        understood<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/8.mp3">그것은 학생들에게 이해되었어</a> = It was
        understood by the students
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/9-1.mp3">집은 청소되었어</a> = The house was
        cleaned<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10-1.mp3">집은 아버지에게 청소되었어</a> = The house
        was cleaned by my dad
      </p>
      <p><em>Again, I highly suggest that you refrain from using this passive voice in Korean. I need you to understand
          what is being introduced here so I can build on it in later lessons. The two sentences above would be better
          said as:</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-3.mp3">학생들은 그것을 이해했어요</a><em> =
          The students understood that</em><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-4.mp3">아버지는 집을 청소했어요</a><em> = My
          dad cleaned the house</em>
      </p>
      <p>The particle ~에 can be used when this part of a sentence is a non-person. For example:</p>
      <p>점심이 학교에 준비되었어요 = The lunch was prepared by the school</p>
      <p>The particle “~에 의해” can also be attached to nouns that are non-people in these situations, but the distinction
        between ~에 and ~에 의해 isn&#8217;t formally introduced until <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/upper-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-4-lessons-76-83/lesson-78/">Lesson
          78</a>, Since I&#8217;m advising against using this passive form, it&#8217;s best to focus on the current
        presentation and not skip ahead.</p>
      <p>Also, remember the meaning of ~(으)로 which you learned in <a
          title="Lesson 12: Korean Particles 들, only, from, 부터/까지, (으)로"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-12/">Lesson 12</a>. You learned that
        ~(으)로 can be used to indicate with what tool/device/method/material something is carried out. This means that
        you can say something like:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-5.mp3">저는 집을 청소기로 청소했어요</a> = I
        cleaned the house with a vacuum cleaner</p>
      <p>But, if you wanted to say that sentence by using the passive verb (to be cleaned), you would have to again use
        ~(으)로 as the particle attached to 청소기 because that was the <em>method/tool </em>that was used for it to be
        cleaned:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14.mp3">집은 청소기<strong>로</strong> 청소되었어</a>
        = the house was cleaned by a vacuum cleaner, whereas:<br />
        집은 청소기<strong>에</strong> 청소되었어 = is not correct, although most Korean people would probably understand you.</p>
      <p>Wow. Confusing.</p>
      <p>It’s confusing for me, I’m sure it is confusing to you, and it is actually confusing to Korean people as well –
        so don’t get too hung up on the difference between ~에/에게 /~(으)로 in these situations because, as I said – Korean
        people don’t use passive verbs as much as they use active verbs.</p>
      <p>What do you need to take from all of this? Because it is so confusing, I wrote the main points that you should
        know:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clauses ending in a passive verb can never have a word with an object marker (를/을) within the clause.</li>
        <li>Passive verbs are conjugated just like active verbs, even though they feel like adjectives</li>
        <li>Though clauses ending in a passive verb cannot have an object in the clause, other particles can be attached
          to nouns to indicate how the passive action occurred. These particles are usually:
          <ol>
            <li>에 – to indicate that something occurred due to a non-person</li>
            <li>에 의해 – to indicate that something occurred due to a non-person, but we haven&#8217;t studied this
              specifically yet</li>
            <li>에게 – to indicate that something occurred due to a person</li>
            <li>~(으)로 – to indicate the tool/method by which something occurred</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>One other thing. Just because a noun in a passive sentence has the particle ~에 (or ~에게, or ~에 의해 for that
        matter) attached to it, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that is the noun that caused the passive verb to
        occur. ~에 could also have its more familiar function of designating a place. For example, we saw this sentence
        before:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-1.mp3">세금은 포함돼요</a> = the tax is
        included</p>
      <p>I could put the noun &#8220;값&#8221; in the sentence to indicate the location of where the tax is included in.
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16.mp3">세금은 값에 포함된다</a> = The tax is
        included in the price</p>
      <p>Notice in the example above that the particle &#8220;~에&#8221; is not denoting that the tax is included <em>by
        </em>the price. Rather, it is included <em>in </em>the price. Being able to recognize things like this just
        takes practice and your understanding of this will increase as you progress through your studies. For now, try
        not to focus too much on the tiny parts of this lessons, and focus more on the big-picture.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Passive Verbs – </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">받다</span></p>
      <p>In addition to the usual way of switching 하다 with 되다 to make a passive verb – there is another (similar) way of
        making these verbs passive. This can only be done with certain verbs (usually acting on people), and is done by
        switching 하다 with 받다 (to receive). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/17.mp3">저는 저의 형을 존경해요</a> = I respect my

        respected (literally-my brother receives respect)

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Passive Verbs – Non-</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> verbs</span></p>
      <p>So far you have only learned how to change ~하다 verbs into the passive tense. There are, of course many verbs in
        Korean that don’t end in ~하다. When dealing with words not ending in 하다, there is often a separate (but very
        similar) word that can be used to indicate the passive voice. These words will always be presented separately in
        the vocabulary lists. Here are some examples:</p>
      <p>켜다 = to turn on<br />
        켜지다 = to be turned on</p>
      <p>끄다 = to turn off<br />
        꺼지다 = to be turned off</p>
      <p>닫다 = to close<br />
        닫히다 = to be closed</p>
      <p><em>The words above are just some examples of active verbs and their passive equivalents. There are many more
          of these active-passive pairs, and unfortunately there is no way to instinctively know which one is active and
          which one is passive. In all of the examples above, the longer word (i.e. the word with one more syllable) is
          the passive verb. However, sometimes the longer word is the active verb, for example:</em></p>
      <p>붙다<em> = to be attached</em><br />
        붙이다<em> = to attach</em></p>
      <p>끓다<em> = to be boiling</em><br />
        끓이다<em> = to boil</em></p>
      <p><em>If you look at these examples, you might think “Oh, so maybe the pattern is – if there is an active-passive
          pair where “이” is the difference between the two, then the longer word will be the active verb.”
          Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Here are two other examples of active-passive pairs that show the
          opposite:</em></p>
      <p>쓰다<em> = to write</em><br />
        쓰이다<em> = to be written</em></p>
      <p>보다<em> = to see</em><br />
        보이다<em> = to be seen</em></p>
      <p><em>There are many instances of these active-passive pairs in Korean, and there is no way to know which one is
          active or which one is passive unless you have specifically memorized it. This is just something that you will
          have to memorize whenever you come across it. The only thing that is helpful is that the active verb usually
          looks very similar to the passive verb – with just one syllable added or deleted from the active form. </em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8AqNY6Lyzo"><em>I talk about passive verbs, and the use of</em>
          줄다<em> (to be decreased) and</em> 줄이다<em> (to decrease) in this YouTube video.</em></a></p>
      <p><a

            also talk about it in this video, where 열리다 is used.</em></a></p>
      <p>You can treat these passive verbs just like the passive verbs you learned in the previous two sections (되다 and
        받다 verbs). Make sure you use the passive verb and not the active verb (for example – use 닫히다 instead of 닫다 in a
        passive sentence):</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-6.mp3">밥은 학교에 의해 제공된다</a> = food
        is provided by the school<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-7.mp3">밥은 학교에 의해 제공되었다</a> = food
        was provided by the school<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-8.mp3">문은 바람에 의해 닫혔어요</a> = The
        door was closed by the wind
      </p>
      <p>When dealing with these passive verbs however, you need to think about whether or not that passive verb is in
        the <strong>state </strong>of something. For example, every passive verb you learned in the previous two
        sections (하다 to 되다 and 하다 to 받다) were <strong>not </strong>passive verbs in the state of something. For example,
        again:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20.mp3">나는 너의 말에 감동받았어</a> = I was
        impressed with what you said</p>
      <p>Simply means that you were impressed. It does not mean that you are in the state of being impressed. But, in
        these sentences:</p>
      <p>The computer is on.<br />
        The TV is off<br />
        The door is locked</p>
      <p>All of those nouns are in the <strong>state</strong> of something. The computer is in the state of being on,
        the TV is in the state of being off, and the door is in the state of locked. To indicate that something “is in
        the state” of something in Korean, you must add ~아/어 있다 to the passive verb. For example:</p>
      <p><em>As you know, </em>있다<em> has many usages and meanings in Korean. Sometimes </em>있다<em> is a verb, and
          sometimes it is an adjective. When used as ~</em>아/어 있다<em> as described here, </em>있다<em> is a verb. For now,
          this is only important to you when conjugating in the plain form. In the future, there will be other times
          when this distinction will be important.</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24.mp3">저는 컴퓨터를 켰어요</a> = I turned the

      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/28.mp3">저는 문을 잠갔어요</a> = I locked the

        the state of) locked
      </p>
      <p>Notice that ~이/가 is used in the passive sentences above. In most cases, this is usually more natural with these
        types of sentences. Don&#8217;t worry about that for now (I&#8217;ll discuss it in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lesson 17</a>), and focus more
        on how the verbs (both active and passive) are being used.</p>
      <p>I get a lot of people who are confused about this “state” nonsense of these passive verbs. I would like to
        fully describe how these words can be used to describe that something is in a “state” and compare them to the
        same passive verb that is not in that state. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-9.mp3">저는 문을 닫았어요</a> = I closed
        the door<br />
        This sentence is an active sentence. It has an active verb, and has an object. This should be no problem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-10.mp3">문이 닫혔어요</a> = The door
        was closed<br />
        This is a passive sentence. It is indicating that at some point in the past, the door was closed by something or
        someone. This is the exact passive equivalent of “저는 문을 닫았어요” – the only difference is that we have no idea
        who/what closed the door. Though you could assume that the door (after that point) was in the state of “closed”
        this sentence does not specifically indicate that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-11.mp3">문이 바람에 닫혔어요</a> = The
        door was closed by the wind<br />
        This is essentially the same sentence as above, but in this case we know how the door was closed. Again, though
        you could assume that the door (after that point) was in the state of “closed” this sentence does not
        specifically indicate that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-12.mp3">문이 닫혀 있었어요</a> = The
        door was closed<br />
        This is another passive sentence, but notice the difference between this sentence and the two examples above.
        Here, the sentence is specifically indicating that the door was in the state of “closed”. Here, we have
        absolutely no idea if something/somebody had opened it recently; all we know is that, at that time, the door was
        not open.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-13.mp3">저는 문을 닫아요</a> = I close
        the door<br />
        This is another active sentence with an active verb. Though it makes sense, it probably wouldn’t be said like
        this unless there was some sort of adverb or other information in the sentence (for example, “I close the door
        every day at 9:00pm”)</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-14.mp3">문이 닫혀요</a> = The door
        closes<br />
        While technically correct, you would need some other information to make this sentence more natural (for
        example, “the door closes every day at 9:00pm”). This is the exact passive equivalent of “저는 문을 닫아요” &#8211;
        except for that in this example, there is no information given as to who/what will close the door. The sentence
        is not referring to the door being in the state of “closed”, but rather, indicating that door somehow closes.
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-14-s1.mp3">문이 닫혀 있어요</a> = The door
        is closed<br />
        Notice the difference between this example and the one above. This sentence is not referring to the door
        closing. It is only stating that the door is currently in the state of “closed”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-15.mp3">문이 닫힐 거예요</a> = The door
        will close<br />
        Again, this example is referring to the door somehow closing. It is the exact passive equivalent of “저는 문을 닫을
        거예요” – except for that in this example, there is no information given as to who/what will close the door.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-16.mp3">문이 닫혀 있을 거예요</a> = The
        door will be closed<br />
        This is a passive sentence that is indicating that the door will be in the state of “closed” in the future. It
        does not indicate who/what will close the door; all we know is that, at that time in the future, the door will
        be closed.</p>
      <p>Just because an active verb has a passive equivalent, it does not mean you can attach ~아/어 있다 to that word to
        describe that it is in the “state” of something. Typically this is only done for words like on, off, open,
        closed, etc…</p>
      <p>A good example of this not working with a passive verb is with 속이다 and 속다.</p>
      <p>속이다 = to trick somebody<br />
        속다 = to be tricked</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/39.mp3">나는 친구를 속였어</a> = I tricked my
        friend<br />
        This is an active sentence.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-17.mp3">나는 친구에게 속았어</a> = I was
        tricked by my friend<br />
        This is a passive sentence</p>
      <p>나는 속아 있다…<br />
        … I am… in the state of being tricked.<br />
        This doesn’t make sense. Once you’re tricked, you’re tricked. You do not continue being in the state of
        “tricked” like a door continues to be open once it is open.</p>
      <p>Here&#8217;s an example that I am including just because I have the audio for it. I&#8217;m going to get more
        example sentences for this lesson shortly with more audio clips:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/41.mp3">펜이 탁자에 놓여 있었어요</a><br />
        = The pen was (in the state of) laying on the table</p>

      <h3><a name="kpv4"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Passive Verbs – </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">내다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">나다</span></p>
      <p>There are quite a few words in Korean that can either end in 나다 or 내다.</p>
      <p>These two play the same role as 되다 and 하다, where a word ending in 나다 is passive and a word ending in 내다 is
        active. For example:</p>
      <p>끝내다 = to finish<br />
        끝나다 = to be finished</p>
      <p>나다 and 내다 can actually be used as standalone verbs as well as be attached to other words. Both of their
        meanings are very complex and depend heavily on the situation, but their general meanings are:</p>
      <p>나다 = for something to come up/arise/occur<br />
        내다 = to make something come up/arise/occur</p>
      <p>However, not all words ending in 나다 have an equivalent 내다 verb (and vice-versa). For example, 어긋나다 is a word
        (to be out of step with something) but 어긋내다 is not a word. At any rate, the two most common words ending in
        나다/내다 are:</p>
      <p>끝내다 = to finish<br />
        끝나다 = to be finished</p>
      <p>고장 내다 = to break<br />
        고장 나다 = to be broken</p>
      <p>It is very common to use the past tense conjugation of both of these words in the passive voice even when the
        thing is currently broken/finished. In English, we would say these sentences in the present tense, but in theory
        the thing/task was broken/finished in the past. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/42.mp3">숙제는 끝났어요</a> = My homework is
        finished<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/43-1.mp3">컴퓨터는 고장 났어요</a> = The computer is
        broken
      </p>
      <p>It is possible to use the active voice to express these sentences, but the use of “나다” (as seen above) is more
        common than the use of 내다 in these cases. Nonetheless, the following are acceptable:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/44.mp3">저는 숙제를 끝냈어요</a> = I finished my
        homework<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/45.mp3">저는 컴퓨터를 고장냈어요</a> = I broke the
        computer
      </p>
      <p>As I said before, 나다 itself means “for something to come up/arise/occur” which means it can be used in a lot of
        sentences to indicate that some noun “comes up”. Three common ways to use 나다 are with 기억 (a memory) with 생각 (a
        thought) and with 냄새 (a smell):</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/46.mp3">아! 그것이 기억났다!</a> = Ah! I remember
        that! (Literally – my memory came up)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/47-1.mp3">좋은 생각이 났어요!</a> = I have a good
        idea (Literally – a good idea came up)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-18.mp3">그 가방에서 냄새가 났어요</a> = That
        bag is smelly (A smell is coming out of that bag)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-19.mp3">그 방에서 냄새가 났어요</a> = That
        room is smelly (A smell is coming out of that room)
      </p>
      <p><em>Remember that </em>나다<em> is a passive verb and cannot act on an object. Therefore, the particle
          ~</em>이/가<em> must be used on “</em>것<em>.” You will learn more about this sentence structure in the <a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-15/#m3">next lesson</a>.</em></p>
      <p>Another common example of “나다” in use is in the following phrase:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-20.mp3">큰 일 났어요!</a></p>
      <p>Literally, this translates to “a big thing/task/work came up!” In Korean, this expression is used similar to
        the expression “Oh no! Something bad just happened!” A more common expression would probably be “Oh crap!”</p>
      <p>You will see “나다” used with many other words throughout your Korean studies. The most common examples of 나다 (or
        it’s active 내다 form) are the examples above. Other common examples that you will learn shortly are provided
        below. I haven’t included these words in the vocabulary list above, so you don’t need to memorize them now. I am
        simply introducing them to you at this point because they are related to this topic.</p>
      <p>소리 = sound<br />
        소리가 나다 = the verb of a sound happening (for a sound to “come up”)</p>
      <p>화 = anger, rage<br />
        화가 나다 = to be angry (for anger to “come up”)</p>
      <p>사고 = accident<br />
        사고가 나다 = to get into an accident (for an accident to “arise”)</p>
      <p>땀 = sweat<br />
        땀이 나다 = to be sweating (for sweat to “come up”)</p>
      <p>전쟁 = war<br />
        전쟁이 나다 = for a war to start (for a war to “come up”)</p>
      <p>멀미 = motion sickness<br />
        멀미가 나다 = for motion sickness to “come up”</p>
      <p>In a lot of these cases, you will see 나다 conjugated into the past tense when we as English speakers would think
        of the situation in the present tense. To explain this phenomenon, let me bring up an example from before:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/46.mp3">아! 그것이 기억났다!</a> = Ah! I remember
        that!</p>
      <p>Notice here that 나다 is conjugated to the past but I have translated the English sentence into the present
        tense. If you imagine your memory as a thing that can “come up,” in theory, the memory had already came up
        before you said that sentence – therefore making it in the past tense. Here, the context of the conversation can
        inform you if the speaker is referring to something in the past or present tense.</p>
      <p>It is possible to use these words in the present tense, but that would mean that the noun is <em>currently
        </em>coming up. A good example from that list above would be:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-21.mp3">땀이 났어요</a> = I’m
        sweating</p>
      <p>Here again, you can see 나다 conjugated to the past tense but the English sentence is translated into the present
        tense. Just by the nature of the word “나다” (to come out) in Korean, when sweat has “come out” of your body it
        means that you now have sweat on your body which we as English speakers would say as “I’m sweating.”</p>
      <p>When 나다 is conjugating into the present tense in these cases, it insinuates that the thing is currently “coming
        up.” In most situations, the difference is negligible and distinguishing them would really be splitting hairs.
      </p>
      <p>However, let’s split some hairs:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-21.mp3">땀이 났어요</a> = Sweat was
        coming out of my body… which means that there is currently sweat on my body… which means that I am wet from the
        sweat on my body that had previously come out of my body.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-14-s2.mp3">땀이 나요</a> = Sweat is
        literally currently coming out of my body</p>
      <hr />
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-22.mp3">저는 그것이 기억났어요</a> = I
        remembered that… which means that I also currently remember that fact&#8230; which means that I know that fact
        that I had previously remembered</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-23.mp3">저는 그것이 기억나요</a> = That
        memory is literally currently just coming to my mind</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Really, this whole past/present thing is quite advanced and is not something I developed an understanding of
        until many years of exposure to Korean. As a beginner (you are still a beginner if you are only at Lesson 14!)
        you probably don’t need to worry about splitting these hairs. However, when I was learning, I would have wanted
        this to be explained to me at some point, so here I am explaining it to you.</p>
      <p>I should point out that we don’t see this same phenomenon when these words are used in negative sentences. For
        example, if I say:</p>
      <p>그것이 기억이 안 났어</p>
      <p>Does the fact of your memory “<em>not </em>coming up” mean that it is currently not up when you said the
        sentence? Huh…. I can’t even wrap my head around that sentence.</p>
      <p>This type of past-tense-conjugated negative sentence with 나다 would <em>only </em>be used to say that you didn’t
        remember something sometime in the past. If you want to say that you cannot currently remember something, you
        can use the present tense conjugation. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-24.mp3">나는 그때 기억이 안 났어</a> = I
        didn’t remember (that) at that time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-14-25.mp3">나는 그것이 기억 안 나</a> = I
        don’t remember that

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Passive Verbs – Normal verbs</span></p>
      <p>So far, you’ve learned about dealing with 하다/되다/받다 verbs, verbs that can be in a state (닫다/닫히다) and 나다/내다
        verbs. Sometimes, however, a verb that fits none of these conditions can be put into the passive voice. All that
        needs to be done in these cases is to add ~아/어지다 to the verb stem to make it passive. Note that this cannot be
        done with all verbs, but some common examples are:</p>
      <p>주다 = to give<br />
        주어지다 = to be given<br />
        (Note that the word is 주어지다 and <em>not </em>줘지다)</p>
      <p>짓다 = to build<br />
        지어지다 = to be built (짓 + 어 = 지어) + 지다 = 지어지다</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/57.mp3">기회가 주어졌어요</a> = I was given a
        chance<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/58.mp3">그 집은 한국에서 지어졌어요</a> = that house
        was built in Korea
      </p>
      <p>That’s it!</p>
      <p>I warned you earlier, there was a <em>lot</em> of grammar in this lesson. Though all of the grammar in this
        lesson is very important, and must be understood to continue your development of Korean – keep in mind that it
        is always more natural to use active sentences instead of passive sentences in Korean.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="center">I’m sure you are very confused! But I did my best to describe
        everything somebody would need to know when having to worry about the passive voice in Korean.</p>
