          뱃속 = inside a stomach/belly<br />
          꿈속에 = in one’s dream</p>
        <p>Notes: Korean people can’t explain the difference between 안 and 속.</p>
        <p>속 is more commonly used when, if you enter something, the place will be filled with stuff and is not “empty”.
          Conversely, “안” would be more commonly used when, if you enter something, the place is basically empty.</p>
        <p>For example, if you enter water or if you enter your body. In both cases, “속” would be used to refer to the
          inside of a body, or the inside of water. If you enter your body, it is filled with stuff, and if you enter
          the water, it is still all water.</p>
        <p>The opposite is if you are talking about a room, or a building. You can go into those places and it is
          relatively empty.</p>
        <p>Example: 저는 <strong>속</strong>이 안 좋아요 = I don’t feel good (my <strong>insides</strong> aren’t good)

        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “가저오다”</p>
        <p>This is not used when you “bring” a person somewhere. Instead, the word “데려오다” is used</p>
        <p>가져오다 often translates to “to bring” and 가져가다 often translates to “to take.” However, the translation of “to
          bring” could work for both 가져오다 and 가져가다.</p>
        <p>가지다 means “to possess” and “오다” and “가다” mean “to come” and “to go” respectively. Deciding to use 가져오다 or
          가져가다 depends on the point of reference of the acting agent in the sentence to the speaker. Specifically,
          whether the acting agent is coming or going to the location in question.</p>
        <p>Imagine you have money at your house, and you will go to your friend’s house later to give it to him.
          Therefore, you will have to “bring” or “take” (same meaning) that money with you when you head over there. If
          you are currently at your house and are talking to your friend about what you will do, you should use the word
          “가져가다” because you are <u>going</u> to your friend’s house while in possession of the money (저는 돈을 가져갈 거예요).
          In this example, 가져가다 is used and the best English translation would be “I will bring the money.”</p>
        <p>However, imagine you have already arrived at your friend’s house with the money. You can use the word “가져오다”
          because you <u>came</u> to your friend’s house while in possession of the money (저는 돈을 가져왔어요). In this
          example, 가져오다 is used and the best English translation would be “I brought the money.”</p>
        <p>People would read those two examples and think “Oh, so if it is something happening in the future – I should
          use 가져가다 and if it is something happening in the past, I should use 가져오다.”</p>
        <p>No. It has nothing to do with the tense of the sentence. It has everything to do with the point of reference
          of the acting agent of the sentence to the speaker.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine you are at your house with the money. If your friend wants to tell you to “bring the
          money,” he should use the word “가져오다” because you are <u>coming</u> (not going) to him. To his reference, you
          are “coming.” In this case, 가져오다 should be used.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          저는 저의 숙제를 <strong>가져왔어요</strong> = I <strong>brought</strong> my homework<br />
          저는 지갑을 안 <strong>가져왔어요</strong> = I didn’t <strong>bring</strong> my wallet<br />

      <div id="target-id6783cf75a0921" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: The function of “또 다르다” is hard to explain, but it is easier to explain (and understand) if you think
          of it as two separate words (which it actually is). It is a combination of the adjective “다르다” and the adverb
          “또”, which is used when something happens again.</p>
        <p>“또 다르다” is used when one particular thing has already been described, and you are explaining <em>another
          </em>thing. For example, imagine you are sitting in a meeting with your coworkers discussing potential
          problems for a plan. People are all discussing the problems they see, and you can point out:</p>
        <p>또 다른 문제는 그것이 비싸요 = Another problem is it (that thing) is expensive</p>
        <p>In this same respect, you can say the following sentence, and although the translation in English is similar,
          try to understand the difference in adding “또”:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/50-1.mp3">저는 또 다른 영화를 봤어요</a> = I saw
          ANother movie<br />

        저는 한국어를 배웠어요 = I learned Korean</p>
      <p>And then subsequently learned “공부하다” (to study), it would be easy to figure out that you could also say:<br />
        저는 한국어를 공부했어요 = I studied Korean.</p>
      <p>However, there are many words that you would not be able to pick up instinctively because they follow different
        rules or patterns. In this lesson, I want to teach you about some of these words. I also want to use this lesson
        as a means to teach you some small concepts in Korean that you should know. These concepts are important, but
        are too small to have an entire lesson dedicated to that one concept. So, I have included them in this
        “miscellaneous” lesson:</p>
      <h3><a name="m2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">More about </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">좋다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">싫다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">좋아하다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">싫어하다</span></p>
      <p>I have told you a few times that in <em>most </em>words ending in 하다, you can remove the ~하다 and the remaining
        word then becomes a noun of that verb. For example:</p>
      <p>말 = speech/words/the thing that you say<br />
        말하다 = to speak</p>
      <p>주문 = an order<br />
        주문하다 = to order</p>
      <p>결혼 = marriage<br />
        결혼하다 = to marry</p>
      <p>존경 = respect<br />
        존경하다 = to respect</p>
      <p>This cannot be done with 좋아하다 and 싫어하다. That is:</p>
      <p>좋아 is not a noun that means “likeness” (or whatever), and<br />
        싫어 is not a noun that means “dis-likeness “(or whatever)</p>
      <p>Note, however that 좋아 and 싫어 <em>can</em> be found in sentences, but only as conjugated forms of 좋다/싫다 and not
        as the noun form of 좋아하다 and 싫어하다. You learned in previous lessons that 좋다 and 싫다 are adjectives. As adjectives,
        they can describe an upcoming noun or predicate a sentence. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-1.mp3">저는 좋은 김치를 먹었어요</a> = I
        ate good kimchi<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-2.mp3">김치는 좋아요</a> = Kimchi is good
      </p>
      <p><em>Just a quick note. Only in rare cases would you actually say ‘</em>김치는 좋아요.<em>’ In most cases if you
          wanted to describe </em>김치 <em>by saying it was good, you would use the word </em>맛있다 <em>instead. You would
          only really use this sentence if you/somebody was talking about something bad (like maybe something bad for
          your health), and then you could say “… is bad, but Kimchi is good.” Nonetheless, it is grammatically correct,
          and I am specifically using this sentence to make a point that you will understand later in the lesson.</em>
      </p>
      <p>좋아하다 is made by adding ~아/어하다 to the stem of 좋다. This changes 좋다 from an adjective (good) to a verb (to like).
        Likewise,</p>
      <p>싫어하다 is made by adding ~아/어하다 to the stem of 싫다. This changes 싫다 from an adjective (not good) to a verb (to
        dislike).</p>
      <p>It would be good to note that you can add ~아/어하다 with some other adjectives as well. 좋다 and 싫다 are the most
        common (and the most important) to worry about right now, but other common examples are:</p>
      <p>부끄럽다 = shy (this is an adjective)<br />
        부끄러워하다 = shy (this is a verb)</p>
      <p>부럽다 = envious (this is an adjective)<br />
        부러워하다 = envious (this is a verb)</p>
      <p>Aside from knowing that one is a verb and one is an adjective, you don’t need to worry about these other words
        right now. I talk more about this concept and how they are used differently, but not until much later in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-5/lessons-101-108/lesson-105a/">Lesson 105</a>. For now, let’s
        just focus on 좋아하다 and 싫어하다.</p>
      <p>As a verb, 좋아하다 can be used to indicate that one “likes” something. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-2.mp3">김치는 좋아요</a> = Kimchi is
        good<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.mp3">저는 김치를 좋아해요</a> = I like Kimchi
      </p>
      <p>Likewise, 싫어하다 can be used to indicate that one “dislikes” something. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4-1.mp3">김치는 싫어요</a> = Kimchi is bad/not
        good<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/5-1.mp3">저는 김치를 싫어해요</a> = I don’t like
        Kimchi
      </p>
      <p>However, the use of “좋다” and “싫다” in these sentences is commonly used to say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-2.mp3">김치가 좋아요</a> = I like
        Kimchi<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-3.mp3">김치가 싫어요</a> = I don’t like
        Kimchi
      </p>
      <p>Or, other examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-4.mp3">학교가 좋아요</a> = I like
        school<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-5.mp3">학교가 싫어요</a> = I don’t like
        school
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-6.mp3">맥주가 좋아요</a> = I like
        beer<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-7.mp3">맥주가 싫어요</a> = I don’t like
        beer
      </p>
      <p>The mechanics to how this is done is talked about next.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="m3"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subject – Object – Adjective Form</span></p>
      <p>One of the basic fundamentals of grammar (not just Korean grammar) is that an adjective cannot act on an
        object. This means in Korean you can never have a sentence predicated by an adjective that is acting on a word
        with the object particle ~를/을. This means that you cannot say this:</p>
      <p>저는 김치를 좋다 = I kimchi good<br />
        <em>(this doesn’t make sense in either language)</em>
      </p>
      <p>But, you can say any of these:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-8.mp3">저는 김치를 먹었어요</a> = I ate
        kimchi<br />
        <em>An object predicated by a verb</em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-2.mp3">김치가 좋아요</a> = kimchi is
        good<br />
        A <em>subject</em> predicated by an adjective</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-1.mp3">저는 좋은 김치를 먹었어요</a> = I
        ate good kimchi<br />
        <em>An object being described by an adjective predicated by a verb</em>
      </p>
      <p>That being said, sometimes, Korean people actually DO make sentences that are predicated by adjectives and also
        have an “object.” Remember though, you cannot (100% cannot) use an adjective to act on an object. So how do
        Korean people say this? They do so by adding ~이/가 to the object instead of ~을/를. This technically makes the
        grammar within the sentence correct because there is not an adjective acting on an object. Take a look at the
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2-2.mp3">김치는 좋아요</a> = Kimchi is
        good<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3.mp3">저는 김치를 좋아해요</a> = I like kimchi,
        which can also be said like this<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/13.mp3">저는 김치가 좋아요</a> = I like kimchi
      </p>
      <p>What I am trying to get at here – is that often times in Korean there is an adjective or passive verb that acts
        on objects. However, these adjective/passive verbs must (of course) always be treated as an adjective or passive
        verb.</p>
      <p>Adjectives and passive verbs can never act on objects, so instead of using ~를/을 in these situations, you have
        to use ~이/가. Another example where this is commonly done is with 그립다:</p>
      <p>그립다 = this word is translated as “to miss,” but is usually used when talking about missing a non-person (it is
        sometimes used to say that you miss a person, but we will talk about how to say you miss a person in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lesson 17</a>).</p>
      <p>그립다 is an <em>adjective</em> in Korean (because it actually describes the feeling rather than an action verb).
        This means that if you want to say “I miss Korean food” you cannot say:</p>
      <p>저는 한국 음식<strong>을</strong> 그리워요. Instead, you must say:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/14-1.mp3">저는 한국 음식<strong>이</strong>
          그리워요</a> = I miss Korean food
      </p>
      <p>More examples. Notice that the predicating word of each sentence in an adjective:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15.mp3">나는 네가 자랑스러워</a> = I am proud of
        you<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-1.mp3">나는 그 사람이 싫어</a> = I don’t like
        that person<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-9.mp3">저는 한국이 좋아요</a> = I like
        Korea
      </p>
      <p>You also saw this same phenomenon in the <a title="Lesson 14: Korean Passive Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-14-korean-passive-verbs/">previous
          lesson</a> with passive verbs. Remember, you cannot have a passive verb act on an object. Therefore, we saw
        the following types of examples in the previous lesson:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-10.mp3">저는 그것이 기억나요!</a> = I
        remember that!<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-11.mp3">저는 땀이 나요!</a> = I’m
        sweating!<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-12.mp3">저는 화가 났어요</a> = I was/I
        am angry
      </p>
      <h3><a name="m4"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Word: 들다</span></p>
      <p>The word 들다 in Korean is very difficult because it can be used in so many ways. Two of the most common usages
        are:</p>
      <p>들다 = to carry/hold something<br />
        들다 = to enter/go into something/somewhere</p>
      <p>Both of these usages are overarching situations that most of the usages of 들다 can fit into. The difficulty with
        들다 is, because it can be used in so many different ways, it is often hard to come up with a translation that
        fits all possible situations. Let me show you three examples of how 들다 can be used under the overarching
        situation of “to enter/go into something/somewhere.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/21.mp3">나는 동아리에 들었어</a> = I joined a club
        (I “entered” a club)<br />
        (나는) <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/22.mp3">잠이 들었다</a> = I fell asleep (I
        “entered” sleep)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-13.mp3">저는 그 그림이 마음에 들어요</a> = I
        like that picture (That picture enters my heart)<br />
        <em>The definition of the word </em>마음 <em>generally refers to one’s heart/one’s mind</em>
      </p>
      <p>Now, let me show you examples of how 들다 can be used under the overarching situation of “to carry/hold
        something.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-14.mp3">저는 손을 들었어요</a> = I
        raised my hand (I “held up” my hand/carried my hand)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-15.mp3">저는 가방을 들었어요</a> = I
        carried the/my bag
      </p>
      <p>Okay, so what’s my point?</p>
      <p>Well, I have three points actually.</p>
      <p>1) First, I wanted to introduce how 들다 can be used. With a general understanding of the two overarching usages
        presented here (along with the specific situations outlined in the example sentences), you should be able to
        tackle most usages of 들다 as you continue to study more advanced sentences.</p>
      <p>2) This is really crucial to your development of Korean and how it relates to the meanings you have of words
        from your understanding of English. You have to realize that Korean and English are fundamentally different, and
        it is very difficult to translate sentences sometimes. In cases like these, you should try not to translate the
        meaning of a word directly into a specific definition. Rather, you should be open to the fact that it can have
        many meanings depending on the context.</p>
      <p>For example, imagine if you knew the following words and their definitions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>저 = I/me</li>
        <li>마음 = heart/mind</li>
        <li>들다 = enter</li>
        <li>그림 = picture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And you saw the following sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-13.mp3">저는 그 그림이 마음에 들어요</a></p>
      <p>Would you be able to understand its meaning if I had not explained it to you earlier? Many learners of Korean
        might read that and say “Well, it looks like that person has a picture entering his heart/mind… but I’m not
        quite sure what that means.”</p>
      <p>This is the first of many times where I will encourage you to not translate/understand sentences literally.
        Instead, try to understand what the meaning of a sentence <em>could </em>be based on your understanding of the
        words within it. For example, if you come across the word “들다” in your studies, realize that it can have many
        usages – and just because it doesn’t immediately look like it will translate to “enter” or “carry,” an open mind
        might allow you to see things in different ways.</p>
      <p>3) I specifically wanted to teach you the meaning of 들다 because it is commonly used in compound words, which I
        will talk about in the next section.</p>
      <h3><a name="m5"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Compound Verbs</span></p>
      <p>You will notice (or may have already noticed) that many Korean verbs are made by combining two verbs together.
        This is usually done by adding one verb to the stem of the other, along with ~아/어. When this happens, the
        meanings of both of the words form to make one word. For example:</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>들다 = to enter something<br />
        가다 = to go</p>
      <p>들다 + 가다 = 들 + 어 + 가다<br />
        = 들어가다 = to go into something</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26-1.mp3">아버지는 은행에 들어갔어요</a> = My dad went

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>들다 = to enter something<br />
        오다 = to come</p>
      <p>들다 + 오다 = 들 + 어 + 오다<br />
        = 들어오다 = to come into something</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/27-1.mp3">남자는 방에 들어왔어요</a> = A man came
        into the room</p>
      <hr />
      <p>나다 = to arise out of something/come up/come out<br />
        가다 = to go</p>
      <p>나다 + 가다 = 나 + 아 + 가다<br />
        = 나가다 = to go out of something</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-16.mp3">저는 집에서 나갔어요</a> = I went
        out of home (I left home)</p>
      <hr />
      <p>나다 = to arise out of something/come up/come out<br />
        오다 = to come</p>
      <p>나다 + 오다 = 나 + 아 + 오다<br />
        = 나오다 = to come out of something</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-17.mp3">학생은 학교에서 나왔어요</a> = The

        오다 = to come</p>
      <p>가지다 + 오다 = 가지 + 어 + 오다<br />
        = 가져오다 = to bring something</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-18.mp3">나는 나의 숙제를 가져왔어</a> = I

        I will bring/take my hat</p>
      <p>가져오다<em> often translates to “to bring” and </em>가져가다<em> often translates to “to take.” However, the
          translation of “to bring” could work for both </em>가져오다<em> and </em>가져가다.</p>
      <p>가지다<em> means “to possess” and “</em>오다<em>” and “</em>가다<em>” mean “to come” and “to go” respectively.
          Deciding to use </em>가져오다<em> or </em>가져가다<em> depends on the point of reference of the acting agent in the
          sentence to the speaker. Specifically, whether the acting agent is coming or going to the location in
          question. </em></p>
      <p><em>Imagine you have money at your house, and you will go to your friend’s house later to give it to him.
          Therefore, you will have to “bring” or “take” (same meaning) that money with you when you head over there. If
          you are currently at your house and are talking to your friend about what you will do, you should use the word
          “</em>가져가다<em>” because you are <u>going</u> to your friend’s house while in possession of the money (</em>저는
        돈을 가져갈 거예요<em>). In this example, </em>가져가다<em> is used and the best English translation would be “I will bring
          the money.”</em></p>
      <p><em>However, imagine you have already arrived at your friend’s house with the money. You can use the word
          “</em>가져오다<em>” because you <u>came</u> to your friend’s house while in possession of the money (</em>저는 돈을
        가져왔어요<em>). In this example, </em>가져오다<em> is used and the best English translation would be “I brought the
          money.”</em></p>
      <p><em>People would read those two examples and think “Oh, so if it is something happening in the future – I
          should use </em>가져가다 <em>and if it is something happening in the past, I should use </em>가져오다<em>.” </em></p>
      <p><em>No. It has nothing to do with the tense of the sentence. It has everything to do with the point of
          reference of the acting agent of the sentence to the speaker. </em></p>
      <p><em>For example, imagine you are at your house with the money. If your friend wants to tell you to “bring the
          money,” he should use the word “</em>가져오다<em>” because you are <u>coming</u> (not going) to him. To his
          reference, you are “coming.” In this case, </em>가져오다<em> should be used. </em></p>
      <hr />
      <p>You will come across many of these words when you are learning how to speak Korean. It is not something
        terribly difficult, but is something that you should be aware of (it helps to understand the word if you realize
        that it is made up of two separate words).</p>
      <p>Another word that you will see commonly in these compound words is “돌다”:</p>
      <p>돌다 = to turn/to spin/to rotate</p>
      <p>Examples of compound words:</p>
      <p>돌다 + 보다 = 돌아보다 = to turn around (and see)<br />
        돌다 + 가다 = 돌아가다 = to return/go back<br />
        돌다 + 오다 = 돌아오다 = to return/come back<br />
        돌리다 + 주다 = 돌려주다 = to give back</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/33-1.mp3">저는 9월1일에 캐나다에 돌아갈 거예요</a> = I
        will go back to Canada on September 1<sup>st</sup><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/34.mp3">저는 친구에게 책을 돌려줬어요</a> = I gave my
        friend back his book
      </p>
      <p>That’s good enough for now, but you will continue to see these as you progress through your studies.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Different/Similar/Same in Korean (다르다/비슷하다/같다)</span>
      </p>
      <p>Three words that you have learned in previous lessons are:</p>
      <p>다르다 = different<br />
        비슷하다 = similar<br />
        같다 = same</p>
      <p>Using these words isn’t as straight forward as it would seem, so I wanted to spend some time teaching you how
        to deal with them. Of course, in simple sentences, they can be used just like any other adjectives. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/35.mp3">그것은 비슷해요</a> = That is
        similar<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/36.mp3">우리는 매우 달라요</a> = We are so
        different<br />
        우리는 같아요 = We are the same
      </p>
      <p><em>The sentence above sounds unnatural in Korean. Although “</em>같다<em>” translates to “the same,” in most
          cases (especially in cases like this where nothing is being compared), it is more natural to use the word
          “</em>똑같다<em>,” which usually translates to “exactly the same.”</em></p>
      <p>For example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-20.mp3">우리는 똑같아요</a> = We are
        exactly the same
      </p>
      <p>When comparing things like this in English, we use a different preposition for each word. For example:</p>
      <p>I am similar <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> my friend<br />
        That building is different <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> yesterday<br />
        Canadian people are the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> Korean people</p>
      <p>In Korean, the particle ~와/과/랑/이랑/하고 can be used to represent all of these meanings. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/38.mp3">저는 친구와 비슷해요</a> = I am similar
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/39.mp3">그 건물은 어제와 달라요</a> = That building
        is different <span style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span> yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-21.mp3">캐나다 사람들은 한국 사람들과 같아요</a>
        = Canadian people are the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> Korean people<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-22.mp3">이 학교는 우리 학교와 똑같아요</a> =
        This school is exactly the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> our school
      </p>
      <p>The ability of ~와/과/랑/이랑/하고 to be used in all of these cases creates confusion for Korean people when they
        learn English. You will often hear mistakes from Korean people like:</p>
      <p>&#8220;This school is the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span> our school&#8221;</p>
      <p>Notice in the sentence above that the particle ~와/과/랑/이랑/하고 is used to denote that something is different <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">from</span>, similar <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to</span>,
        or the same <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as</span> something else. In theory, you could change the
        order of the sentences (to make the sentence structure similar to what you learned in <a
          title="Lesson 13: Korean Particles: and, with, to, from, for, about"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-13/">Lesson 13</a>) to indicate that
        two things (this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> that) are different, similar or the same.
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-24.mp3">우리 학교와 이 학교는 똑같아요</a> =
        Our school and this school are exactly the same</p>
      <p>As you can see with the English translation &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t create any difference in meaning. It
        merely changes the wording of the sentences and the function of the particles slightly.</p>
      <p>I talk about the usage of 같다 later in <a title="Lesson 35: It seems to be/might be (~ㄹ 것 같다)"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-35/">Lessons
          35</a> and <a title="Lesson 36: To look like: ~같이 보이다 / ~아/어 보이다"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-36/">36</a>.
        Specifically, in <a title="Lesson 36: To look like: ~같이 보이다 / ~아/어 보이다"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-36/">Lesson
          36</a> I talk about how 같다 is more commonly used to say “something is like something.” I don’t want to get
        into this too much in this lesson, because the purpose of this section was for me to introduce you to the
        grammar within these sentences so you could apply it to what I am about to introduce next.</p>
      <p>Check this grammar out. This is probably an easy sentence to you now:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/43-2.mp3">나는 잘생긴 남자를 만났어</a> = I met a
        handsome man<br />
        Subject – adjective (describing an) – object – verb
      </p>
      <p>What about these next sentences?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/44-1.mp3">나는 비슷한 남자를 만났어</a> = I met a
        similar man, or<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-25.mp3">나는 같은 남자를 만났어</a> = I met
        the same man
      </p>
      <p>These sentences have the same structure as before:<br />
        Subject – adjective (describing an) – object – verb</p>
      <p>That should be easy for you too. But what about if you wanted to say “I met a man who is similar to your
        boyfriend.” Seems too complicated, but let’s break it down:</p>
      <p>너의 남자친구와 비슷하다 = similar to your boyfriend<br />
        비슷하다 is an adjective – which means it can modify a noun:<br />
        비슷한 남자 = similar man</p>
      <p>너의 남자친구와 비슷한 남자 = A man (that is) similar to your boyfriend<br />
        나는 ( &#8212; )를 만났어 = I met &#8212;</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/46-1.mp3">나는 (너의 남자친구와 비슷한 남자)를 만났어</a> =
        I met a man that is similar to your boyfriend</p>
      <p>This structure is very complex and is an introduction to describing nouns with phrases instead of simply using
        one adjective. In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lesson
          26</a>, you will learn more about how to describe nouns with things other than simple adjectives &#8211; such
        as verbs and complex phrases.</p>
      <p>The meaning of “different” in English has more than one nuance, which are possessed by “다르다” as well. Although
        the meaning of “different” in the two sentences below is similar, try to see that they are slightly different:
      </p>
      <p>I am different than him<br />
        I saw a different movie</p>
      <p>The first one describes that something is not the same as something else.</p>
      <p>The second one has a meaning similar to “other” or “another,” where (in this case) the person did not see the
        movie that was originally planned, but instead saw “another” or a “different” movie.</p>
      <p>다르다 can be used in both situations. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-15-s1.mp3">저는 그와 달라요</a> = I am
        different from him<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/48.mp3">저는 다른 영화를 봤어요</a> = I saw a
        different (another) movie
      </p>
      <p>“또 다르다” usually translates to “another,” while “다르다” translates to “other.” However, in the example above,
        replacing “another” with “other” makes it sound weird.</p>
      <p>The function of “또 다르다” is hard to explain, but it is easier to explain (and understand) if you think of it as
        two separate words (which it actually is). It is a combination of the adjective “다르다” and the adverb “또”, which
        is used when something happens again.</p>
      <p>“또 다르다” is used when one particular thing has already been described, and you are explaining <em>another
        </em>thing. For example, imagine you are sitting in a meeting with your coworkers discussing potential problems
        for a plan. People are all discussing the problems they see, and you can point out:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-15-27.mp3">또 다른 문제는 그것이 비싸요</a> =
        Another problem is it (that thing) is expensive</p>
      <p>In this same respect, you can say the following sentence, and although the translation in English is similar,
        try to understand the difference in adding &#8220;또&#8221;:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/50-1.mp3">저는 또 다른 영화를 봤어요</a> = I saw
        ANother movie<br />
        In this, maybe the person saw one movie, and then <em>again </em>saw a different movie.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="m7"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Words that are the same but have different meanings
          (Korean Homonyms)</span></p>
      <p>This may be something that is obvious when learning any language, but I wanted to point it out. In Korean,
        there are a lot of words that have more than one meaning. It is like this in English as well, but most people
        never notice it until they stop to think about how many there actually are. Whenever there is a word with many
        meanings in Korean, these different meanings will always have a separate entry in our vocabulary lists (not
        necessarily in the same lesson, however). An example of this is “쓰다”:</p>
      <p>쓰다 = to write<br />
        쓰다 = to use<br />
        쓰다 = to wear a hat</p>
      <p>Each of these words has had a separate entry in our vocabulary lists. However, when a word has many meanings,
        but most of those meanings can be combined into a few ‘umbrella term’ meanings – only those ‘umbrella term’
        meanings will be shown. A good example we talked about earlier is 들다. 들다 has <em>so </em>many meanings, most of
        which can fit into three or four broad definitions.</p>
      <p>Either way, be aware that many words have many meanings in Korean:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/51.mp3">나는 편지를 친구를 위해 쓸 거야</a> = I am
        going to write a letter for my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/52.mp3">나는 그 기계를 썼어</a> = I used that
        machine<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/53.mp3">저의 아버지는 모자를 항상 써요</a> = My father
        always wears a hat
      </p>
      <p>Another word that has many common meanings is 걸리다:</p>
      <p>걸리다 = to be (in the state of) hanging<br />
        걸리다 = to be caught/stuck/trapped<br />
        걸리다 = to “take” a certain amount of time<br />
        걸리다 = to catch a cold/sickness</p>
      <p>There are more usages, but lets just focus on these four for now:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">걸리다 = to be hanging</span><br />
        Similar to the passive verbs you learned in the <a title="Lesson 14: Korean Passive Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-14-korean-passive-verbs/">previous
          lesson</a>, this verb can be used to indicate the passive ‘state’ of hanging:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/54.mp3">그림은 벽에 걸려 있어요</a> = The picture is
        hanging on the wall</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">걸리다 = to be caught/stuck/trapped</span><br />
        A verb that can be used when something trips/gets caught/gets trapped:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55.mp3">나는 줄에 걸렸어</a> = I tripped over the
        line</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">걸리다 = to “take” a certain amount of time</span><br />
        This is a very useful form that we will talk about in greater detail in a <a
          title="Lesson 77: More ~는데 (그런데) and ~는 데"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/upper-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-4-lessons-76-83/lesson-77/">later
          lesson</a>. You can use this to indicate how long it takes to get from one place to another:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/56.mp3">서울부터 인천까지 2시간 걸려요</a> = It takes 2
        hours to get from Seoul to Incheon<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/57-1.mp3">우리 학교에서 식당까지 10분 걸려요</a> = It
        takes 10 minutes to get from our school to the restaurant
      </p>
      <p>Notice however, that even though each of these has a very different meaning in English (to be hanging, to be
        caught, to take a certain amount of time) they are actually pretty similar. When a picture is ‘hanging’ on the
        wall, technically it is ‘stuck/trapped’ on the wall. Similarly, if you go from Incheon to Seoul, the time it
        takes (2 hours) is ‘stuck/trapped.’ Haha, No? Well, that’s just the way I explained it to myself when I first
        learned some of these words.</p>
      <p>Try to think outside of the English box. One word in Korean is often used to represent many words in English.
        Usually these words aren’t actually very different, but the different translations lead us to believe that they
        are in fact very different. Read these sentences again and see if you can understand them this way:</p>
      <p>The picture is caught on the wall<br />
        I was caught over the line<br />
        2 hours are caught to get from Seoul to Incheon</p>
      <p>Obviously not natural in English – but you can probably understand what these sentences mean.</p>
      <p>My point? Just because it looks like a word has many meanings doesn’t necessarily mean that those meanings are
        vastly different from each other. Think about the example from earlier in this lesson (들다) one more time. 들다 has
        many meanings – but most of which can be grouped into only 2 or 3 different meanings. Always keep this in mind.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="m8"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being Sick in Korea</span></p>
      <p>One of the things people often try to learn first when learning a new language is how to express themselves in
        the event that they have to go to the doctor. This is something that wouldn’t fit into any specific lesson, so I
        want to cover it here:</p>
      <p>You already know the word 아프다, which you can use to indicate that you are sick OR sore in some place. In
        English “sore” and “sick” mean slightly different things. Because of this, Korean people (who are learning
        English) often mistakenly say “My arm is sick.” Also note that 아프다 is an adjective… and for some reason ‘이/가’
        are used instead of 는/은when creating sentences about a place on your body:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/58-1.mp3">배가 아파요</a> = My stomach is
        sore<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/59.mp3">팔이 아파요</a> = My arm is sore<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/60.mp3">저는 어제 너무 아팠어요</a> = I was very sick
        yesterday
      </p>
      <p>Also, you can use the word 걸리다 to indicate that you have some sort of disease/sickness. You learned a little
        bit about 걸리다 in the previous section. This usage of 걸리다 essentially has the same meaning that was described in
        all the other examples of 걸리다 (I am caught in a sickness). Korean people use this in the following way:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/61.mp3">저는 감기에 걸렸어요</a> = I caught a
        cold/I have a cold<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/62.mp3">저는 독감에 걸렸어요</a> = I caught the
        flu/I have the flu<br />
        <em>Notice how &#8220;</em>에<em>&#8221; is used in these sentences due to </em>걸리다<em> having the nuance of
          being stuck IN something</em>
      </p>
      <p>Also note that even though you have a cold in the present tense, Korean people use the past “걸렸다” to express
        that they currently have a cold.</p>
      <p>기침 (a cough) and 재채기 (a sneeze), although not originally nouns of Chinese origin, are both nouns where you can
        add 하다 to get the respective verb form (to cough and to sneeze). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/63.mp3">저의 아들은 시끄럽게 기침했어요</a> = My son
        coughed loudly<br />
        <i>(Probably more naturally translated to “My son was coughing loudly.” Korean people don’t really distinguish
          between simple and progressive past tenses as much as we do in English. You will learn about the progressive
          tense in <a title="Lesson 18: Present Progressive ~고 있다; To be Getting ~아/어지다"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-18/">Lesson 18</a>.) </i>
      </p>
      <p>Wow that&#8217;s a long lesson. I have to apologize for writing these lessons so long. This lesson could have
        easily been broken into 2, 3 or even 4 separate lessons, but I chose against doing it that way. When I was first
        learning Korean, I wanted to plow through material as fast as I possibly could &#8211; and I guess that is
        coming out as I am writing these lessons as well.</p>
