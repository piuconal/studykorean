      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson25v1.mp3">모든</a> = <span

        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          모든 것 = everything<br />
          모든 사람 = every person</p>
        <p>Notes: This looks like the dictionary form of this word should be “모드다” and ~ㄴ/은 is added to is to describe
          an upcoming noun. 모든 is the dictionary form of this word. It is placed before nouns to mean “all/every…”</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-2.mp3"><strong>모든</strong> 학생들은
            하루 종일 잤어</a> = <strong>All</strong> students slept all day<br />

          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-26.mp3"><strong>모든</strong>
            선생님들은 똑똑해요</a> = <strong>Every</strong> teacher is smart<br />
          우리 선생님은 <strong>모든</strong> 학생들을 좋아해요 = Our teacher likes <strong>all</strong> students<br />
          <strong>모든</strong> 한국 사람들이 밥을 먹어요 = <strong>All</strong> Korean people eat rice<br />
          <strong>모든</strong> 학생들은 감기에 걸렸어요 = <strong>All</strong> the students have the flu
      </div>

        <p>Examples:<br />
          저는 <strong>모든</strong> <strong>것</strong>을 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat <strong>everything<br />

      <div id="target-id6783d3c8767e5" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 한국 <strong>어디나</strong> 여행하고 싶어요 = I want to travel <strong>everywhere</strong> in Korea<br />
          우리는 동남아시아에 <strong>어디나</strong> 갈 거예요 = We will go <strong>everywhere</strong> in South East Asia<br />
          밥은 <strong>어디나</strong> 맛이 똑같아요 = Rice tastes the same <strong>everywhere</strong>

      <div id="target-id6783d3c876814" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Example:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-44.mp3"><strong>누구나</strong> 그
            여자를 알아요</a> = <strong>Everybody</strong> knows that girl<br />

          <strong>누구나</strong> 한국을 좋아해요 = <strong>Everybody</strong> likes Korea
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson25v6.mp3">뭔가</a> = <span
          class="collapseomatic noarrow" id="id6783d3c87682b" tabindex="0" title="something">something</span>
      <div id="target-id6783d3c87682b" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: The subject and object particles in general can be omitted from any sentence (although I don’t suggest
          omitting particles until you have a very deep understanding of Korean), but they seem to be more commonly
          omitted from these types of sentences.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 방금 <strong>뭔가</strong>(를) 봤어요 = I just saw <strong>something</strong> a minute ago<br />
          등에 <strong>뭔가</strong>(가) 있나요? = Is there <strong>something</strong> on my back?<br />
          저는 팔에 <strong>뭔가</strong>(가)느껴져요 = I feel <strong>something</strong> on my arm<br />
          저는 <strong>뭔가</strong>(를) 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat <strong>something</strong><br />
          저는 <strong>뭔가</strong>(를) 말하고 싶어요 = I want to say <strong>something</strong>
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson25v7.mp3">어딘가</a> = <span
          class="collapseomatic noarrow" id="id6783d3c876842" tabindex="0" title="somewhere">somewhere</span>
      <div id="target-id6783d3c876842" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: By the nature of the word “somewhere,” you are most likely to use the particles ~에 or ~에서 in these
          sentences. It would be acceptable to omit the particle ~에 from 어딘가 but less acceptable to omit the particle
          ~에서.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 열쇠를 <strong>어딘가</strong>(에) 두었어요 = I left my keys <strong>somewhere<br />
          </strong>전쟁이 아시아 <strong>어딘가</strong>에서 났어요 = A war broke out <strong>somewhere</strong> in Asia<br />
          피가 <strong>어딘가</strong>에서 나오고 있어요 = Blood is coming out of <strong>somewhere</strong><br />
          선생님들이 회의를 <strong>어딘가</strong>에서 하고 있어요 = The teachers are having a meeting <strong>somewhere</strong><br />
          저는 휴일에 <strong>어딘가</strong>에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go <strong>somewhere</strong> on the holiday<br />
          저는 <strong>어딘가</strong>에서 커피를 마시고 싶어요 = I want to drink a cup of coffee <strong>somewhere</strong>
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson25v8.mp3">언젠가</a> = <span
          class="collapseomatic noarrow" id="id6783d3c87685a" tabindex="0" title="sometime, some day">sometime, some
          day</span>
      <div id="target-id6783d3c87685a" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: ~에 is typically not attached to 언젠가. In both English and Korean, it isn’t logical to make sentences
          with “until somewhere” or “from somewhere.”</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 <strong>언젠가</strong> 선생님이 되고 싶어요 = I want to become a teacher <strong>someday<br />
          </strong>그 날이 <strong>언젠가</strong> 올 거예요 = The day will come <strong>sometime</strong><br />
          구름이 <strong>언젠가</strong> 걷힐 거예요 = The clouds will clear <strong>eventually/sometime</strong><br />
          저는 <strong>언젠가</strong> 경찰관이 되고 싶어요 = I want to become a police officer <strong>someday</strong><br />
          저는 <strong>언젠가</strong> 중국어도 배우고 싶어요 = I want to learn Chinese as well <strong>some day</strong><br />
          저는 <strong>언젠가</strong> 고향에 돌아가고 싶어요 = I want to return (go back) to my hometown <strong>some day</strong>
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson25v9.mp3">누군가</a> = <span

      <div id="target-id6783d3c876870" class="collapseomatic_content ">

          저는 <strong>누군가</strong>의 열쇠를 찾았어요 = I found <strong>somebody’s</strong> keys<br />
          경찰관들은 <strong>누군가</strong>와 얘기하고 있어요 = The policemen are talking with <strong>somebody</strong><br />
          <strong>누군가</strong>가 지갑을 잃어버렸어요 = <strong>Somebody</strong> lost their wallet

          </strong>저는 이 선물을 <strong>아무</strong>에게나 주고 싶어요 = I want to give this present to
          <strong>anybody</strong><br />
          저는 <strong>아무</strong>하고나 축구를 하고 싶어요 = I want to play soccer with <strong>anybody</strong>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>Once again, the vocabulary list of this lesson <em>is </em>the lesson. While all slightly similar, these words
        are very difficult to understand on their own, so I dedicated an entire lesson to making you understand them.
        Here, you will learn how to say:</p>
      <p>Every-<br />
        (everybody, every time, everywhere, etc…)</p>
      <p>Any-<br />
        (anybody, anytime, anywhere, etc…)</p>
      <p>Some-<br />
        (somebody, sometime, somewhere, etc…)</p>
      <p>No-<br />
        (nobody, nowhere, nothing)</p>
      <p>I left spaces in the vocabulary list between different sets of these words (for no reason other than to make it
        organized).</p>
      <h3><a name="251"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything/Everywhere/Every
          time/Everyone</span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything/All<br />
        </span></p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">모든</span></p>
      <p>The most common way to say “every _____” is to place the word ‘모든’ before a noun. 모든 looks, sounds, and acts
        like an adjective, but it can not be used to predicate a clause or sentence. This means that you won&#8217;t see
        the word &#8220;모든&#8221; at the end of a sentence, just like in English. For example, you can&#8217;t say
        something like:</p>
      <p>He is every&#8230;</p>
      <p>Even though 모든 ends in ~ㄴ (which is the same as all adjectives when placed immediately before a noun to
        describe them – 예쁜, 아름다운, 똑똑한), the dictionary form of 모드다 does not exist.</p>
      <p>However, as I mentioned, (like an adjective) “모든” can be placed before a noun. If you place “모든” before a noun,
        it has the meaning of “every _____.” For example:</p>
      <p>모든 것 = everything<br />
        모든 사람 = all people/every person<br />
        모든 과일 = all fruits/every fruit<br />
        모든 선생님 = all teachers/every teacher</p>
      <p>Those can now go in sentences very easily:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-1.mp3">모든 아시아 사람들은 젓가락을 잘 쓴다</a>
        = All Asian people use chopsticks well<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-2.mp3">모든 학생들은 하루 종일 잤어</a> = All
        students slept all day
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">다</span></p>
      <p>Another possible word to use in similar situations is 다. 다 is used as an adverb in sentences to indicate that
        “all” of something is done.</p>
      <p>One way this is done is to use it in a sentence with an object to indicate that some action was completed
        without leaving anything behind. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-1.mp3">저는 라면을 다 먹었어요</a> = I ate
        all the ramen<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-2.mp3">저는 숙제를 다 했어요</a> = I did
        all of my homework<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-3.mp3">저는 소설을 다 읽었어요</a> = I read
        the whole book – or – I read all the books<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-4.mp3">저는 월급을 이미 다 썼어요</a> = I
        already spent all of my paycheque
      </p>
      <p>In these situations using “모든” and “다” create a slightly different meaning. ‘다’ is more about doing one action
        to completion and leaving nothing behind. 모든 is indicating that the action was performed on all possible nouns
        after “모든”. For example, if I say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-1.mp3">저는 라면을 다 먹었어요</a> = I ate
        all of the ramen</p>
      <p>In this sentence, I am indicating that I have completed the action of “eating ramen” and nothing was left
        behind. In other words, there is no ramen left in my bowl because I ate it all.</p>
      <p>However, in this sentence:</p>
      <p>저는 모든 라면을 먹었어요 = I ate every ramen</p>
      <p>This sentence is a little bit ambiguous and a little but unnatural because in most situations you wouldn’t say
        this. However, bear with me as I use it to explain the difference in nuance. In this situation, there might have
        been many different types of ramen at my house. I would use this sentence to indicate that I ate/tried “every
        one of them.” It is ambiguous as to whether or not I finished eating them, which means that there could still be
        some left – either in my bowl or in the cupboard.</p>
      <p>If you did actually eat every one of them and finished all of the ramen in your house, it would be more natural
        to use “저는 라면을 다 먹었어요” because the action was completed and nothing was left behind.</p>
      <p>This is why I provided two translations for this sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-3.mp3">저는 소설을 다 읽었어요</a> = I read
        the whole book<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-3.mp3">저는 소설을 다 읽었어요</a> = I read
        all the books
      </p>
      <p>Depending on the situation, that sentence could be translated to either of those English translations. In the
        first sentence, the action of ‘reading’ was completed on the subject (one book) without leaving any pages behind
        within that book. In the second sentence, the action of ‘reading’ was completed on the subject (more than one
        book) without leaving any pages behind in any of those books.</p>
      <p>However, by just saying:</p>
      <p>저는 모든 소설을 읽었어요</p>
      <p>I am more indicating that I have tried reading every book, but there is no indication on if I have finished
        reading any of them.</p>
      <p>다 can also be used to indicate that all the members/things that represent a subject do some action (or are some
        adjective). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-5.mp3">사람들이 다 왔어요</a> = All the
        people have come<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-6.mp3">사람들이 다 죽었어요</a> = All the
        people died<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-7.mp3">부모님은 다 그래요</a> = All
        parents are like that<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-8.mp3">남자들은 다 게을러요</a> = All men
        are lazy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-9.mp3">학생들은 다 공부하고 있어요</a> = All
        of the students are studying<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-10.mp3">애기들이 다 낮잠 자고 있어요</a> = All
        the babies are taking a nap
      </p>
      <p>In these cases, I have noticed that there is effectively no difference between using 다 or 모든. For example, each
        of these sentences would have the same meaning:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-11.mp3">모든 사람들이 왔어요</a> = All the
        people have come<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-12.mp3">모든 사람들이 죽었어요</a> = All the
        people died<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-13.mp3">모든 부모님은 그래요</a> = All
        parents are like that<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-14.mp3">모든 남자들은 게을러요</a> = All men
        are lazy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-15.mp3">모든 학생들은 공부하고 있어요</a> = All
        of the students are studying<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-16.mp3">모든 애기들이 낮잠을 자고 있어요</a> =
        All the babies are taking a nap
      </p>
      <p>The only difference I can feel is that ‘모든’ is considering the subjects (although groups of people) almost as
        unique individuals/things within the group, whereas ‘다’ is describing the subjects a groups. At this point, this
        is not something you need to worry about. Understanding the precise nuance is more about feeling (which you will
        develop with time).</p>
      <p>The similarities in these usages allow them to be used in the same sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>모든 사람들이 다 왔어요 = All the people have come<br />
        모든 사람들이 다 죽었어요 = All the people died<br />
        모든 부모님은 다 그래요 = All parents are like that<br />
        모든 남자들은 다 게을러요 = All men are lazy<br />
        모든 학생들은 다 공부하고 있어요 = All of the students are studying<br />
        모든 애기들이 다 낮잠 자고 있어요 = All the babies are taking a nap</p>
      <p>All of these can also be used in negative sentences, for example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-17.mp3">사람들이 다 안 왔어요</a> = Not
        all the people have come<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-18.mp3">저는 라면을 다 안 먹었어요</a> = I
        didn’t eat all of the ramen<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-19.mp3">저는 숙제를 다 하지 못했어요</a> = I
        couldn’t do all of my homework
      </p>
      <p>다 can also be used as a noun. In this form, it is usually placed before 이다 or 아니다 to indicate that something is
        (or isn’t) “all.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-20.mp3">그게 다야?</a> = Is that
        all<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-21.mp3">이게 다가 아니야</a> = This isn’t
        all
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">모두</span></p>
      <p>There is also another word that you should be aware of: “모두,” which has the meaning of “all.” It can generally
        be used in the following ways:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an adverb<br />
        </span>In these cases, 모두 essentially has the same meaning as “다.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-24.mp3">선생님들은 모두 똑똑해요</a> = All
        teachers are smart, which could also be written as:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-25.mp3">선생님들은 다 똑똑해요</a> = All
        teachers are smart, or<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-26.mp3">모든 선생님들은 똑똑해요</a> = Every
        teacher is smart
      </p>
      <p>In this adverb form, 다 can also be placed after 모두 in the <em>same</em> sentence. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-27.mp3">선생님들은 모두 다 똑똑해요</a> = All
        teachers are smart</p>
      <p>In this adverb form, you would not see particles attached to it.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As a (pro)noun<br />
        </span>In these cases 모두 typically means “everybody” or “everything.” Particles are usually attached to it. For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-22.mp3">모두가 이해했어요</a> = Everybody
        understood<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-23.mp3">모두가 산책하고 있어요</a> =
        Everybody is going for a walk
      </p>
      <p>Here’s the part that is a bit confusing. Often times when the sentence structure is just Subject – 모두 – Verb,
        the ~를 is omitted from 모두. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 모두를 이해했어 would be better said as:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-24.mp3">나는 모두 이해했어</a> = I
        understood everything
      </p>
      <p>And</p>
      <p>저는 모두를 먹고 싶어요 would be better said as:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-25.mp3">저는 모두 먹고 싶어요</a> = I want
        to eat everything
      </p>
      <p>It took me a long time to come to this conclusion, but my explanation as to why this is done is because in
        these cases 모두 is acting as an adverb. Therefore, it is not so much that the ~를 is being omitted, but rather
        that the 모두 is serving a different function (and the sentence ends up having the same meaning anyways).</p>
      <p>Just like how you would not see ~를 attached to 다 in the following sentences:</p>
      <p>나는 다 이해했어 = I understood everything<br />
        저는 다 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat everything</p>
      <p>Often times a word that represents a group of people is placed before 모두. In these cases, ~를 is usually
        attached to 모두. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-26.mp3">저는 가족 모두를 사랑해요</a> = I
        love all of my family<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-27.mp3">저는 학생 모두를 가르쳤어요</a> = I
        taught all of the students
      </p>
      <p>The same structure works when the group of people is the subject of a sentence. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-28.mp3">학생 모두가 기숙사로 갔어요</a> = All
        of the students went to the dorm<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-29.mp3">가족 모두가 고향에 갔어요</a> = All
        of the/my family went to the/our hometown<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-30.mp3">선생님 모두가 회의에 갔어요</a> = All
        of the teachers went to a meeting
      </p>
      <p>Other particles can be attached to it as well, for example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-31.mp3">저는 선물을 모두에게 주었어요</a> = I
        gave a present to everybody
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everywhere/Every time/Everyone</span></p>
      <p>~나 can be added to the words ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘who’ to mean ‘everywhere,’ ‘every time,’ and ‘everyone.’
        Particles are usually not added to these words. For example:</p>
      <p>어디 = where<br />
        어디나 = everywhere</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-38.mp3">나는 한국에서 어디나 여행하고 싶어</a> =
        I (would) want to travel everywhere in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-32.mp3">우리는 동남아시아에 어디나 갈 거예요</a> =
        We will go everywhere in South East Asia<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-33.mp3">밥은 어디나 맛이 똑같아요</a> = Rice

      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>~ㄴ가 can be added to the words ‘what,’ ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘who’ to mean ‘something,’ ‘somewhere,’ ‘sometime,’
        and ‘somebody.’ For example:</p>
      <p>뭐 = what<br />
        뭔가 = something</p>
      <p>The subject and object particles in general can be omitted from any sentence (although I don’t suggest omitting
        particles until you have a very deep understanding of Korean), but they seem to be more commonly omitted from
        these types of sentences. Many examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-47.mp3">나는 방금 뭔가(를) 봤어</a> = I

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>어디 = where<br />
        어딘가 = somewhere</p>
      <p>By the nature of the word “somewhere,” you are most likely to use the particles ~에 or ~에서 in these sentences.
        It would be acceptable to omit the particle ~에 from 어딘가 but less acceptable to omit the particle ~에서. Many
        examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-53.mp3">열쇠를 어딘가(에) 뒀어</a> = I

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>언제 = when<br />
        언젠가 = sometime/someday</p>
      <p>~에 is typically not attached to 언젠가. Many examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-49.mp3">그 날이 언젠가 올 거예요</a> = The

        I want to return (go back) to my hometown some day
      </p>
      <p>When I first learned about this word, I wondered if particles like ~까지 or ~부터 could be attached to it because
        언젠가 represents a time. I kept bugging Korean people to try to make me example sentences of these particles
        attached to 언젠가 and they always came up with nothing. I realized that in both English and Korean, it isn’t
        logical to make sentences with “until someday” or “from someday.”</p>

      <p>In <a title="Lesson 22: Asking Questions in Korean: How, What, Which, How Many"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-22/">Lesson 22</a>, you learned
        about using 어느 in sentences. Another usage of 어느 is to reference a vague place or point in time. I am including
        this explanation in this section of the lesson because of the similarities with the sentences above.</p>
      <p>You would often see this type of thing in stories, poetry or news reports where the specific location does not
        need to be given. This would be similar to something like this at a start of a story in English:</p>
      <p>A long time ago in a far-away castle, or<br />
        A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away</p>
      <p>In this usage, 어느 is commonly placed before a broad indication of time or place. For example:</p>
      <p>어느 날 = some day (an ambiguous day)<br />
        어느 밤 = some night (an ambiguous night)<br />
        어느 겨울 = some winter (an ambiguous winter)<br />
        어느 여름 = some summer (an ambiguous summer)<br />
        어느 마을 = some village (an ambiguous village)<br />
        어느 시장 = some market (an ambiguous market)</p>
      <p>Here, the person speaking/writing this way because he/she does not need to specifically reference the time.
        Some example sentences:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-59.mp3">어느 겨울 꽃이 다 사라졌다</a> =
        Some winter, all the flowers disappeared<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-60.mp3">어느 마을에서 애기 두 명이 태어났다</a> =
        Two babies were born in some village<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-58.mp3">그 다음 날, 할머니가 어느 시장을 구경하고
          있었다</a> = The next day, the grandmother was browsing around some market
      </p>
      <p>Again, like I said, you would most likely see these types of sentences used in stories, often setting up the
        scenario or something within a book.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is also possible to use a question word to refer to an ambiguous place, thing or person. This is most
        commonly done with the following words:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어디</span><br />
        Person 1: 엄마가 집에 있어? = Is mom at home<br />
        Person 2: 아니요. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">어디</span> 갔어. = No, she went <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">somewhere</span></p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">뭐</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
        </span>우리가 이미 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">뭐</span> 먹었어요 = We already ate <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">something</span></p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">누구</span><br />
        나는 내일 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">누구</span> 만날 거야 = Tomorrow I’m going to meet <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">somebody</span></p>
      <p>Using these words like this is quite advanced, and is not something I learned until a few years of exposure
        with Korean. What makes these usages even more confusing is that you can use these words in sentences when you
        are asking a question. For example:</p>
      <p>뭐 먹었어요? Could mean both:<br />
        &#8211; What did you eat? or<br />
        &#8211; Did you eat something?</p>
      <p>어디 갔어요? Could mean both:<br />
        &#8211; Where did you go? or<br />
        &#8211; Did you go somewhere</p>
      <p>누구(를) 만났어요? Could mean both:<br />
        &#8211; Who did you meet? Or<br />
        &#8211; Did you meet somebody</p>
      <p>Distinguishing them, believe it or not, can be done quite easily if you train your ear correctly. When using
        “뭐, 어디 or 누구” as the question word in the sentence, the stress of the sentence is on the question word itself.
        Pay close attention to the audio in the following examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-1.mp3">뭐 먹었어요?</a> = What did
        you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-2.mp3">어디 갔어요?</a> = Where did
        you go?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-3.mp3">누구 만났어요?</a> = Who did you
        meet?
      </p>
      <p>When using “뭐, 어디 or 누구” to refer to an ambiguous thing, place or person, the stress of the sentence is on the
        verb. Again, pay close attention to the audio in the following examples, and specifically how they differ from
        the examples above:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-4.mp3">뭐 먹었어요?</a> = Did you eat
        something?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-5.mp3">어디 갔어요?</a> = Did you go
        somewhere?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-6.mp3">누구 만났어요?</a> = Did you
        meet somebody?
      </p>
      <p>As I mentioned however, this is quite advanced. You might not be able to hear the difference at this stage in
        your learning, but it is good to be aware of as you continue to progress through your studies.</p>
      <p><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
      <h3><a name="253"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">아무</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          Anybody/Nobody</span></p>
      <p>아무 is a pronoun that refers to “any” person. When using it in a sentence, the speaker is indicating the person
        he/she is referring to is not a specific “set” person, but could actually be “anybody.”</p>
      <p>It is most commonly used with ~나 attached to it. This particle (when attached to other nouns as you will learn
        in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-3-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-3-lessons-51-58/lesson-58/">Lesson
          58</a>) often indicates the same indifference meaning that “아무” itself has.</p>
      <p>When used together, it can almost be seen as one unit that means “anybody.” As ~나 is actually a particle in
        itself, when used as the subject or object of a sentence, particles ~는 or ~가 are not usually doubled up on top
        of ~나. For example:</p>
      <p>아무나 그 책을 좋아할 거예요 = Anybody will/would like that book<br />
        이렇게 좋은 학교에서는 아무나 공부를 잘 할 거예요 = Anybody can study well at this school</p>
      <p>However, particles can be added before ~나 if the word being used has other functions within a sentence (other
        than the subject or object). Because 아무 refers to a person in this case, the most common particles you would see
        here are particles meaning “to” (~에게/한테) and “with” (~와/하고). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-61.mp3">나는 아무와나 사귀고 싶어</a> = I
        want to go out with anybody<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-62.mp3">저는 이 선물을 아무에게나 주고 싶어요</a>
        = I want to give this present to anybody<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-63.mp3">저는 아무하고나 축구를 하고 싶어요</a> =
        I want to play soccer with anybody
      </p>
      <p>When ~도 replaces ~나 in these cases, we get the opposite meaning. 아무도 can be used as the subject or object of a
        sentence to mean “nobody.” Just like 아무나, particles are not usually attached to 아무도 as “~도” is actually the
        particle being used.</p>
      <p>When using 아무도, the sentence must be conjugated in a negative way or end with some negative word like 없다. This
        is counter intuitive for English speakers – because it makes us think we are saying a double negative. For
        example, the following sentence:</p>
      <p>집에 아무도 있어요 <em>looks </em>like it should mean “there is nobody at home.” However, as I said, a sentence with
        “아무도” should end in a negative way. Therefore, this is correct:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-64.mp3">집에 아무도 없어요</a> = There is
        nobody at home/There isn’t anybody at home</p>
      <p>Because of the double negative in the Korean version, this creates a confusing translation for the English
        version. In the English version, we can usually say either “anybody” with a negative conjugation, or “nobody”
        with a positive conjugation.</p>
      <p>For example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-65.mp3">저는 아무도 못 봤어요</a> = I
        didn’t see anybody/I saw nobody<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-66.mp3">저는 아무도 만나고 싶지 않아요</a> = I
        don’t want to meet anybody/I want to meet nobody<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-67.mp3">아무도 집에 가지 않았어요</a> =
        Nobody went home<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-86.mp3">아무도 나를 좋아하지 않아</a> =
        Nobody likes me
      </p>
      <p>Particles can be added before ~도 if the word being used has other functions within a sentence (other than the
        subject or object). Because 아무 refers to a person in this case, the most common particles you would see here are
        particles meaning “to” (~에게/한테) and “with” (~와/하고). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-68.mp3">저는 그 말을 아무에게도 안 했어요</a> =
        I didn’t say that to anybody/I said that to nobody<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-69.mp3">저는 아무하고도 얘기하고 싶지 않아요</a> =
        I don’t want to talk with anybody/I want to talk with nobody
      </p>
      <p><em>It is very easy to be confused with these double negatives at first. To make it simple at the beginning,
          just tell your brain to use “</em>아무나<em>” when you want to say something that ends positively, and to use
          “</em>아무도<em>” when you want to say something that ends negatively. In theory, </em>아무나<em> and </em>아무도<em>
          are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">same</span> word in Korean (with different particles
          attached). One just happens to be used with positive sentences, and the other happens to be used in negative
          sentences.</em></p>
      <p><em> </em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">아무 Used Before Other Nouns</span></p>
      <p>Another function that 아무 has is to be placed before a thing/place/time to describe it. The most common nouns
        you will see after 아무 are:</p>
      <p>거 = short form of 것, meaning “thing”<br />
        데 = meaning “place”<br />
        때 = meaning “time”</p>
      <p>When ~나 is attached to these nouns, the speaker is indicating that the thing/place/time is not a specific
        “thing/place/time,” but could actually be “anything,” “anywhere” or “anytime.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-89.mp3">저는 아무 거나 먹고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to eat anything (I’d eat anything)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-90.mp3">아무 때나 좋아요</a> = Anytime is
        good<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-70.mp3">저는 아무 데나 가고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to go anywhere (I’d go anywhere)
      </p>
      <p>In the example above, you can see that “데” is used to refer to a place. When the verb being used requires “~에”
        to be attached to that place, “~에” is omitted. However, when the verb being used requires “~에서” to be attached
        to that place “~에서” should be added before ~나.</p>
      <p>For example, even though the same place is being used in both sentences below, because of the nature of the
        verbs 가다 and 먹다, ~에 should be used in one case, and ~에서 should be used in the other.</p>
      <p>저는 공원에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go to the park<br />
        저는 밥을 공원에서 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat in the park</p>
      <p>The difference between these two sentences is the same as the difference between these two sentences:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-70.mp3">저는 아무 데나 가고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to go anywhere<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-71.mp3">저는 아무 데서나 먹고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to eat (at) anywhere
      </p>
      <p>~도 can replace ~나 in these cases to have the meaning of “nothing” or “nowhere.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-93.mp3">저는 아무 것도 먹고 싶지 않아요</a> =
        I don’t want to eat anything/I want to eat nothing<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-94.mp3">아기는 아무 데도 가지 않았어</a> = The
        baby didn’t go anywhere/The baby went nowhere
      </p>
      <p><em>“</em>아무 때도<em>” means “no time?” This doesn’t make sense. Instead, the word </em>전혀<em> (introduced in <a
            title="Lesson 34: Explanations for Difficult Words"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-34/">Lesson
            34</a>) should be used.</em></p>
      <p>It is possible to use other nouns after 아무. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Lesson25-72.mp3">저는 아무 버스나 타고 갈 거예요</a> =
        I’m going to take any bus and leave<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-96.mp3">저는 아무 말도 하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn’t say anything/I said nothing<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-97.mp3">저는 엄마랑 아무 관계도 없어요</a> = I
        don’t have any relationship with my mother/I have no relationship with my mother
      </p>
      <p>However, by far the most common three things to use after 아무 are 거, 데 and 때.</p>
      <p>I would love to provide way more examples, but many of the examples I want to make with 아무 (and the words it
        can create) use grammatical principles that you haven’t been introduced to you yet. The two most common
        grammatical principles that you haven’t learned yet that would be used in these situations are:</p>
      <p>Making a command (introduced in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-34-41/lesson-40/">Lesson
          40</a>), and<br />
        One can/cannot do (Introduced in <a title="Lesson 45: One can/cannot – ~ㄹ/을 수 있다/없다"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-42-50/lesson-45/">Lesson
          45</a>)</p>
      <p>Here are some quick examples using those two principles. The only reason I am showing you these is because I
        think it is likely you have learned about these either by looking ahead or by using some other resource.</p>
      <p>Making a command<br />
        가방을 아무 데나 두세요 = Put your bag down anywhere<br />
        아무 거나 고르세요! = Choose anything!<br />
        아무 거나 먹자! = Let’s eat anything!</p>
      <p>One can/cannot do<br />
        아무나 그것을 할 수 있어요 = Anybody can do that</p>
      <p>It also might be helpful to take a peek at <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-3-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-3-lessons-51-58/lesson-58/">Lesson
          58</a> to see how ~나 can be used when not used in these specific cases of 아무나, 아무 거나, 아무 때나, etc. In theory, I
        should have presented these words <em>after </em>I taught you about ~나, but in my opinion the use ~나 as it is
        used in this lesson is more common (and therefore more important) than the general use of ~나 introduced later.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Each (마다)</span></p>
      <p>마다 means “each” and is attached directly to the end of a noun:</p>
      <p>날마다 = each day<br />
        학생마다 = each student<br />
        금요일마다 = each/every Friday<br />
        30분마다 = each/every 30 minutes</p>
      <p>When I first learned about this, I asked the following question to my grammar teacher:</p>
      <p>“What is the difference between ‘모든 학생’, and 학생마다?”</p>
      <p>The answer is so subtle, but there is a difference. The <em>only </em>way I can explain it is by saying the
        following:<br />
        If you can explain the difference between “every student” and “each student” in English, then you fully
        understand the difference between “모든 학생” and “학생마다.”</p>
      <p>But really, <em>can </em>you explain the difference between “every student” and “each student?” There is a
        difference. I know there is a difference. “Each” has something to do with ‘each individual student,’ whereas
        “every” has something to do with ‘all students.’… huh?</p>
      <p>I don’t know. I always think I can explain the difference between “each” and “every” in English, but it’s too
        confusing.</p>
      <p>Just remember that 마다 means “each” and “모든” means “every.” That is more than enough.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-98.mp3">그 버스는 10분마다 와요</a> = That
        bus comes each/every 10 minutes<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson25-99.mp3">학생마다 달라요</a> = Each
        student is different
      </p>
      <p>… and with that, you have finished Unit 1! You have come a <em>really </em>long way from our first lessons.
        When you first started learning through our website, you were learning sentences like: “나는 선생님이다.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully you enjoyed our first unit, and hopefully you didn’t get too confused – because in Unit 2 you will
        start learning Korean grammar concepts that will not only make your sentences much more complex, but also make
        your head explode.</p>
