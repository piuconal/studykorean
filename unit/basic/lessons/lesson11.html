      <p>*June (6월/유월) and October (10월/시월) should actually be 육월 and 십월 but, written like that, they are difficult to
        pronounce. Because of this, their correct pronunciations are 유월 and 시월 NOT 육월 and 십월.</p>

        <p>Notes: If I asked 100 people in Canada what their job is, I would probably only get the answer “office
          worker” a few times. In Korea however, probably 50% of the people would respond with “office worker.” Many
          Korean people work for big companies in offices, not all doing the same thing obviously, but I’m not exactly
          sure what they’re all doing in there. Korea has no real natural resources, so the major industry is just
          “working and business.”</p>
        <p>You will see the suffix “원” attached to different words to refer to people.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          한국에서는 <strong>회사원</strong>이 진짜 많아요 = There are a lot of <strong>office workers</strong> in Korea<br />
          우리 회사는 새로운 <strong>회사원</strong>을 찾고 있어요 = Our company is looking for new <strong>workers</strong>

        <p>Notes: You will see the suffix “사” attached to different words that indicate some sort of specialized job.
          For example: 의사 (doctor), 교사 (teacher), 강사 (instructor)</p>
        <p>Example:<br />

        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “두렵따”</p>
        <p>두렵다 follows the ㅂ irregular</p>
        <p>Notes: 무섭다 and 두렵다 both translate to “scary.” 무섭다 is more typically used to describe the feeling of being
          scared, usually as it applies to something shocking or something outright scary like snakes or spiders. 두렵다 is
          more about psychological things in the future, like the fear of death or the fear of tomorrow.</p>
        <p>두렵다 and 무섭다 typically describe that something is scary, but it can be used to indicate that you are scared of
          that thing by using the Subject – Object – Adjective form introduced in Lesson 15.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          그녀를 잃는 것이 <strong>두려워요</strong> = I am <strong>afraid</strong> of losing her<br />

          that it actually means “three days” by looking it up in the Korean-Korean dictionary with them.</p>

        <p>Notes: 지난 can be placed before some indicators of time to mean “last ….”</p>
        <p>There are two similar but different meanings for the word “last” in English. 지난 is used for only ONE of those
          meanings. 지난 is used to talk about something in the past, as in “last night I went to bed late.” It is not
          used to talk about the last thing in a sequence. See Lessons 10 and 11 for more information.</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>In this lesson, you will build on what you learned in Lesson 10 by learning how to use a variety of different
        words of time in Korean. Using these words, you will be able to say “I did X <strong>for</strong> 2 months” or
        “I didn’t do Y <strong>last</strong> week.” You will also learn whether you should use the pure Korean or
        Sino-Korean numbers when using these different words of time.</p>
      <p>The use of pure Korean or Sino-Korean numbers may seem random, but there is a reason for it. Anytime the
        &#8216;time&#8217; word is of Chinese origin, the Sino-Korean numbers are used. For example &#8220;개월&#8221;
        (month) is counted using Sino-Korean numbers, because &#8220;개월&#8221; is of Chinese origin and has
        corresponding Chinese (<a title="Hanja Unit 1: Lessons 1 – 20"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/hanja-unit-1-lessons-1-20/">한자</a>) characters. &#8220;달&#8221; (also
        meaning month) is a Korean word, and thus, is counted using Korean numbers. A lot of Korean words are of Chinese
        origin and have corresponding Chinese (<a title="Hanja Unit 1: Lessons 1 – 20"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/hanja-unit-1-lessons-1-20/">한자</a>) characters. You will learn about
        those later.</p>
      <p>This lesson is a little bit less organized than the previous lessons. It was difficult to teach everything in
        this lesson together because you need to have a mutual understanding of all concepts in order to understand one
        of them. In order to understand how to use 동안, you need to know how to use 주. But in order to understand how to
        use 주, you should understand how to use 동안. Around and around we go. Anyways, I made it as simple as possible.
        After this lesson, any time you learn about other &#8216;time&#8217; grammar concepts, it should be really easy
        because this lesson will give you a solid base to work from.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="for"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“For” a certain amount of time (동안)<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>동안 is a very useful word that can be used to indicate how long an action occurs. It is typically placed after a
        duration of time, for example:</p>
      <p>2분 = 2 minutes<br />
        2분 동안 = <em>for</em> 2 minutes</p>
      <p>10분 = 10 minutes<br />
        10분 동안 = <em>for</em> 10 minutes</p>
      <p>이틀 = two days<br />
        이틀 동안 = <em>for</em> two days</p>
      <p>동안<em> can also be used to indicate that an action occurs &#8220;while&#8221; another action occurs. You will
          learn about that application in <a title="Lesson 33: ~중 (하는 중), (~중에)"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-33/">Lesson
            33</a> after learning some key grammar points in the lessons to come.</em></p>
      <p>Those can then be added into sentences to indicate how long one does something for. Notice also that no
        additional particle is added to 동안. One would think that 에 should be added, but it is not.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence1.mp3">저는 10분 동안 걸었어요</a>
        = I walked for 10 minutes<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence2.mp3">저는 30분 동안 공부했어요</a>
        = I studied for 30 minutes
      </p>
      <p>While the translation of “동안” in these examples is usually “for”, in essence, what you are doing is stating
        “for that period of time.” Understanding this will help you understand later usages of “동안” in future lessons.
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence1.mp3">저는 10분 동안 걸었어요</a>
        = I walked for (a period of) 10 minutes<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence2.mp3">저는 30분 동안 공부했어요</a>
        = I studied for (a period of) 30 minutes<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence3.mp3">저는 이틀 동안 안 잤어요</a> =
        I didn’t sleep for two days
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>Remember:</p>
      <p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you use the word or the numeral when writing a number. However, typically the word
        is written when a pure Korean word is used with a counter like 개, 명, 번, 시간, 대, 살, etc. In situations where
        Sino-Korean numbers are written (for example, in the sentences above) it makes no difference if you write the
        numeral or the word.</p>
      <p>Also remember that the spacing is different depending on if you write a numeral or a word. If writing the word,
        there should be a space between the number and the word. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence1.mp3">저는 십 분 동안 걸었어요</a>
      </p>
      <p>If writing a numeral, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you include a space or not. Both are seen as acceptable:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence1.mp3">저는 10분 동안
          걸었어요<br />
        </a><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence1.mp3">저는 10 분 동안
          걸었어요</a></p>
      <hr />
      <p>I want to show you more and more examples of 동안, and I expect you might not want to limit yourself to only “분”
        (minutes), so lets move on to hours.</p>
      <h3><a name="khours"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Hours (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">시간</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>Talking about minutes is easy because you always simply use 분. For example:</p>
      <p>3시 20분 means “3:20”, and<br />
        20분 동안 means “for 20 minutes”</p>
      <p>When talking about hours, however, 시 is used when talking about the hour on a clock, whereas 시간 is used when
        counting hours. Notice the difference between these two sets:</p>
      <p>3시 = 3:00<br />
        세 시 = Three o&#8217;clock</p>
      <p>3시간 동안 = for 3 hours<br />
        세 시간 동안 = for three hours</p>
      <p>Remember that pure Korean numbers are used when talking about hours. I usually write out the Korean word when
        I&#8217;m referring to an amount of hours as in the examples below. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-6.mp3">저는 세 시간 동안 잤어요</a> = I
        slept for 3 hours<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence4.mp3">저는 한 시간 동안 달렸어요</a>
        = I ran for one hour<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence5.mp3">저는 여덟 시간 동안
          운전했어요</a> = I drove for eight hours<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence6.mp3">저는 어제 한 시간 동안 야구를
          했어요</a> = I played baseball for an hour yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-10.mp3">저는 어제 두 시간 동안 TV를 봤어요*</a>
        = I watched TV for two hours yesterday
      </p>
      <p><em id="__mceDel"> *Notice that </em>보다<em id="__mceDel"> (to see) is used when watching something. You can
          also use </em>보다<em id="__mceDel"> when you watch a performance or concert, or similar things. In English “I
          saw a TV” and “I watched TV” have two different meanings, but Koreans simply say “I see TV.”</em></p>
      <p>At this point you are probably asking saying “Okay, I understand how to say that I have done things for X hours
        or minutes, but what about if I want to say something like:</p>
      <p>I will eat in three hours, or<br />
        I ate three hours ago</p>
      <p>I will go in 10 minutes, or<br />
        I came 10 minutes ago”</p>
      <p>You will learn how to create those types of sentences when you learn about 전 and 후 in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-24/">Lesson 24</a>. For the moment,
        there is a ton of content in this lesson, so try to focus on what is presented here.</p>
      <h3><a name="kseconds"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Seconds (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">초</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>When talking about seconds, you need to use the Sino-Korean numbers. When putting a number before
        &#8220;초,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you use the word or the numeral. For example:</p>
      <p>1초 = 1 second<br />
        일 초 = one second</p>
      <p>2초 = 2 seconds<br />
        이 초 = 2 seconds</p>
      <p>2초 동안 = for 2 seconds<br />
        이 초 동안 = for two seconds</p>
      <p>Examples in sentences:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-11.mp3">저는 2초 동안 달렸어요</a> = I ran
        for 2 seconds<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence7.mp3">저는 그 사람을 10초 동안
          만났어요</a> = I met that person for 10 seconds<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence8.mp3">1분은 60초입니다</a> = One
        minute is sixty seconds
      </p>
      <h3><a name="lastnext"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Last/Next (지난</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">다음)</span></p>
      <p>지난 and 다음 are two words that you can use in many situations, including in situations related to time. In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/unit-1-lesson-10/">Lesson 10</a>, you learned
        about 마지막, which can be used to refer to the “last” or “final” thing in a sequence. Remember, Korean people use
        another word when referring to a “previous” (or last) thing, as in: “I saw a movie <strong>last</strong> (the
        previous) week.”</p>
      <p>In order to refer to a “previous” thing, the word “지난” can be used. I drew a picture to depict the image I have
        in my head distinguishing 마지막 and 지난. Imagine you are on a six week trip, and you are currently in your fourth
        week of the trip. You can use “지난” to refer to the <em>previous</em> week, and you can use “마지막” to refer to the
        <em>final </em>week. (You can refer to them both as “last week” in English). For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast.png"
          rel="attachment wp-att-13680"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13680"
            src="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast.png" alt="LastLast" width="499"
            height="172"
            srcset="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast.png 499w, https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast-300x103.png 300w, https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast-100x34.png 100w, https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastLast-200x69.png 200w"
            sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></a></p>
      <p>지난 can be added immediately before <strong>some</strong> words of time (I discuss “some” a little bit later) to
        refer to a “previous” thing. This often translates to “last,” though. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-14.mp3">저는 지난 주에 영화를 봤어요</a> = I
        saw a movie last week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-15.mp3">저는 지난 주에 캐나다에 갔어요</a> = I
        went to Canada last week.<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-16.mp3">저는 지난 수업을 안 들었어요</a> = I
        didn’t go to/attend the last/previous class
      </p>
      <p><em>In order to say “attend a class,” Korean people say “</em>수업을 듣다<em>,” which literally translates to
          “listen to/hear a class.” As such, you can see that the particle ~</em>을<em> is attached to “</em>수업<em>”
          because “the class” is the noun that is being listened to. Korean learners are sometimes confused as to why
          “~</em>에<em>” is not attached to “</em>수업<em>” because they are accustomed to the English way of saying “I
          didn’t go to the last class”.</em></p>
      <p><em>Also, note that this sentence is also correct, but is referring to a different class than
          above:</em><em><br />
        </em>저는 마지막 수업을 안 들었어요<em> = I didn’t attend the last class</em></p>
      <p>지난 can be added only before <em>some</em> words of time. For example, you couldn’t say “지난 분/지난 초.” These would
        mean “last minute/second” as in ‘the last minute/second&#8217; that just passed – which doesn’t make any sense.
        Notice that they do not have the meaning of “I handed in my paper at the <strong>last minute</strong>.” This
        meaning refers to the last minute in a sequence of minutes; therefore, “마지막” must be used in this case.</p>
      <p>시간, however, means “time” in addition to being a counter for “hours.” So, “지난 시간” can be used to mean “last
        time” (but not “last hour”).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-17.mp3">저는 그것을 지난 시간에 배웠어요</a> =
        I learned that (thing) last time</p>
      <p>You can also use the word 번 to refer to the last “time” something happened.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence9.mp3">저는 그것을 지난 번에
          배웠어요</a> = I learned that (thing) last time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence10.mp3">우리가 지난 번에 계획이
          없었어요</a> = We didn’t have plans last time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence11.mp3">우리는 지난 번에 돼지고기를
          먹었어요</a> = We ate pork last time
      </p>
      <p>다음 is used in the same way as 지난, but it means “next.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-21.mp3">저는 다음 주에 영화를 볼 거예요</a> =
        I will see a movie next week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-22.mp3">저는 다음 주에 캐나다에 갈 거예요</a> =
        I will go to Canada next week
      </p>
      <p>Like above, 다음 can be used with 시간 to mean “next time,” but not “next hour.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence12.mp3">우리는 다음 번에 학교에 갈
          거예요</a> = We will go to school next time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence13.mp3">우리는 다음 시간에 학교에 갈
          거예요</a> = We will go to school next time
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence14.mp3">나는 너를 다음 번에 방문할
          거야</a> = I will visit you next time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence15.mp3">나는 너를 다음 시간에 방문할

      <h3><a name="kdays"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Days (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">일</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">날</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하루)</span></p>
      <p>Days are very confusing in Korean because there are a few different words you need to be acquainted with. You
        learned the names of the days of the week in the vocabulary section of another lesson. You should have noticed
        that every day of the week ends in 일. 일 means “day” but it is never used alone (if it is used alone, it means
        ‘work’). I’m looking at my Korean calendar now, and see a variety of words ending in “일.” Don’t worry about
        these words now, just recognize the importance of “일” within them:</p>
      <p>총선 = general election<br />
        총선<strong>일</strong> = the day of the general election (election day)<br />
        현충<strong>일</strong> = Memorial day</p>
      <p>일 is also the counter for days. You learned in <a title="Lesson 10: Korean Numbers"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/unit-1-lesson-10/">Lesson 10</a> that you
        must use pure Korean numbers when counting. When you count days, however, you use Sino-Korean numbers. When
        putting a number before &#8220;일,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you use the word or the numeral.</p>

          않았어요</a> = We didn’t meet for 6 days
      </p>
      <p>To make things more confusing, if you are counting days from 1 – 10 there is a word that corresponds to “one
        day,” another word that corresponds to “2 days,” another word that corresponds to “3 days” etc… The most common
        of these words is 하루 which means “one day.” 하루 is used much more than 일 일. But 2일 (이 일)/3일 (삼 일)/4일 (사 일)/5일 (오
        일)/etc are used more than their corresponding words.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-31.mp3">저는 하루 동안 여행했어요</a> = I

      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>You can also place a (Sino-Korean) number before 일 to refer to a specific day in a month. It seems like it
        would be easy to confuse when one is talking about the day of a month (3일) and when doing something for a
        specific period (3일). But, in sentences, these are easily distinguishable:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence21.mp3">나는 3일에 수업을 들었어</a>
        = I went to class on the 3rd (day of the month)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence22.mp3">나는 3일 동안 수업을
          들었어</a> = I went to class for three days
      </p>
      <p>You can refer to a specific day and month by adding #일 after #월:</p>
      <p>3월 2일 = March 2nd<br />
        5월 25일 = May 25th</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence23.mp3">저는 8월 15일에 도착할
          거예요</a> = I will arrive on August 15th<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence24.mp3">저는 이 여권을 1월 2일에
          받았어요</a> = I received my passport on January 2<sup>nd</sup>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>날 is another word that means “day” and can be used as a stand alone word, but not counted. It is used when
        talking about a specific day by itself. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-40.mp3">저는 그 날에 갔어요</a> = I went
        on that day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-41.mp3">저는 그 날에 계획이 있어요</a> = I
        have plans on that day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence25.mp3">저는 그 날에 선생님이
          되었어요</a> = I became a teacher on that day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence26.mp3">우리는 그 날에 시작할
          거예요</a> = We will start on that day
      </p>
      <p>If you want to talk about doing something on the first/second/third day, you can use 번째 (which you learned in
        the previous lesson) with 날. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence27.mp3">우리는 두 번째 날에 서울에
          갔어요</a> = We went to Seoul on the second day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence28.mp3">우리는 둘째 날에 서울에
          갔어요</a> = We went to Seoul on the second day
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence29.mp3">우리는 세 번째 날에 안
          만났어요</a> = We didn’t meet on the third day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence30.mp3">우리는 셋째 날에 안
          만났어요</a> = We didn’t meet on the third day
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence31.mp3">저는 네 번째 날에 계획이
          없어요</a> = I have no plans on the fourth day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence32.mp3">저는 넷째 날에 계획이
          없어요</a> = I have no plans on the fourth day
      </p>
      <p>첫날 is a word that specifically refers to the first day:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence33.mp3">저는 첫날에 명동에 갔어요</a>
        = I went to 명동 on the first day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence34.mp3">저는 첫날에 그 여자를
          만났어요</a> = I met that girl on the first day
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="kweeks"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Weeks (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">주)</span></p>
      <p>Weeks in Korean can be used in sentences just like 일 (day) except that there are no other weird words to worry
        about. You use Sino-Korean numbers when talking about weeks:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-52.mp3">저는 다음 주에 미국에 갈 거예요</a> =
        I will go to the US next week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-53.mp3">지난 주에 저는 계획이 많았어요</a> = I
        had a lot of plans last week
      </p>
      <p>The word “주” can also be used as a counter to count weeks. When counting weeks, just like when counting days,
        Sino-Korean numbers are used. When putting a number before &#8220;주,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you use
        the word or the numeral. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence35.mp3">저는 2주 동안 한식을 안
          먹었어요</a> = I didn’t eat Korean food for 2 weeks<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence36.mp3">저는 4주 동안 여자친구를 안
          만났어요</a> = I didn’t meet my girlfriend for 4 weeks
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence35.mp3">저는 이 주 동안 한식을 안
          먹었어요</a> = I didn’t eat Korean food for two weeks<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence36.mp3">저는 사 주 동안 여자친구를 안
          만났어요</a> = I didn’t meet my girlfriend for four weeks
      </p>
      <p>The word “주일” can also be used as a counter for weeks. This is acceptable, but it sounds a bit more natural to
        use “주” as shown above. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence37.mp3">저는 2주일 동안 한식을 안
          먹었어요</a> = I didn’t eat Korean food for two weeks<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence38.mp3">저는 4주일 동안 여자친구를 안
          만났어요</a> = I didn’t meet my girlfriend for four weeks
      </p>
      <h3><a name="kmonths"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Months (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">달</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">개월)</span></p>
      <p>First, notice that the names of each month correspond to the number of the month in the calendar For example:
      </p>
      <p>January = 1월<br />
        February = 2월<br />
        December = 12월</p>
      <p>When counting months, you can either use 달 or 개월. When using 달, you must use the pure Korean numbers, and when
        using 개월, you must use the Sino-Korean numbers. There is no difference in meaning, and both are used frequently.
        When putting a number before 달, I prefer to write the Korean word. When putting a number before 개월, it
        doesn&#8217;t matter if you use the word or the numeral.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-58.mp3">저는 두 달 동안 한국어 수업을
          들었어요</a> = I took a Korean class for 2 months</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence39.mp3">저는 2개월 동안 한국어 수업을
          들었어요</a> = I took a Korean class for 2 months<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence39.mp3">저는 이 개월 동안 한국어 수업을
          들었어요</a> = I took a Korean class for 2 months
      </p>
      <p>My Korean grammar teacher told me years ago that ‘동안’ is actually incorporated into the meaning of 달, which
        would mean that you wouldn’t have to say 동안 after 달. Still, though, most people use 동안 after 달.</p>
      <h3><a name="kyears"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Years (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">년)</span></p>
      <p>Years are used just like weeks, which means that you must use the Sino-Korean numbers. When putting a number
        before &#8220;년,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t matter if you use the word or the numeral:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-60.mp3">저는 3년 동안 형을 안 만났어요</a> =
        I didn’t meet my brother for 3 years<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-61.mp3">저는 10년 동안 한국어를 공부했어요</a> =
        I studied Korean for 10 years
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-60.mp3">저는 삼 년 동안 형을 안 만났어요</a> =
        I didn’t meet my brother for three years<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-61.mp3">저는 십 년 동안 한국어를 공부했어요</a> =
        I studied Korean for ten years
      </p>
      <p>However, if you want to say “last/next year” in Korean, you can’t use “지난/다음 년.” Instead, you must use separate
        words:</p>
      <p>작년 = last year<br />
        내년 = next year, for example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-62.mp3">나는 내년에 한국에 갈 거야</a> = I
        will go to Korea next year<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence40.mp3">그 사람은 작년에 죽었어요</a>
        = That person died last year
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="this"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This Week/This Month/This Time (이</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">번)</span></p>
      <p>Finally, you can use 이번 just like 지난/다음 when talking about weeks or months to mean “this week/this month.” You
        cannot say “이번 년,” instead you must use the separate word “올해.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-64.mp3">저는 이번 주에 계획이 없어요</a> = I
        have no plans this week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-65.mp3">저의 어머니는 올해 한국에 올 것입니다</a>
        = My mom will come to Korea this year<br />
        <em>Note here that it is common to see “</em>에<em>” omitted from the word “</em>올해<em>.” You can also see in the
          section above that this is not the case with </em>작년 <em>and </em>내년.
      </p>
      <p>You cannot use 이번 when talking about minutes/seconds/hours. “I want to go to school <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">this hour</span>” doesn’t make any sense. But remember, in addition to
        meaning ‘hour’ 시간 also means “time.” This means that you can say 이번 시간 to mean “this time,” which is usually
        used when talking about “this time in class.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-66.mp3">우리는 이번 시간에 많이 배웠어</a> =
        We learned a lot this time</p>
      <p>In most other cases, it is more natural to use “이번에” instead of “이번 시간:”<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-67.mp3">나는 너를 이번에 안 만날 거야</a> = I
        won’t meet you this time
      </p>
      <p>번 can also be added after 지난/다음 to mean “last/next time”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-68.mp3">저는 박물관에 다음 번에 갈 거예요</a> =
        I will go to the museum next time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson11-69.mp3">저는 박물관에 지난 번에 갔어요</a> = I
        went to the museum last time
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="per"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Per”</span></p>
      <p>When talking about each of these units of time, you can add the particle ~에 to indicate <em>within </em>that
        unit of time, how much something was done. You can usually translate this to “per” in English. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence41.mp3">저는 이 약을 하루에 두 번
          먹어요</a> = I eat (take) this medicine twice per day<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence42.mp3">저는 그 친구를 1주일에 한 번
          만나요</a> = I meet that friend once per week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence43.mp3">저는 여기에 한 달에 세 번
          와요</a> = I come here three times per month<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson11sentence44.mp3">저는 1년에 두 번 미국에
          가요</a> = I go to America twice per year
      </p>
      <p>Almost all the examples in this lesson used 동안. There are other ways you can talk about these time words
        without using 동안 (for example, “I will go to Canada 3 days from now”). However, this lesson was reaching the 6
        page mark, and I didn’t want to overload you more than I already have. I feel like the material in this lesson
        alone is enough to make your head spin for a while, so I will end it here.</p>
      <p>In later lessons, you will learn how to apply the concepts you learned in this lesson to more complicated
        sentences.</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s it for this lesson!</p>
