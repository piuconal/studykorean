          sister<br />
          친동생 = biological younger sibling
        </p>
        <p>Notes:<br />
          While technically this word means “younger sibling” Korean will refer to a close friend (who is younger than
          them) using this word. This often leads to dialogues like this:</p>
        <p>Korean person: “Hey! This is my 동생!”<br />
          Me: “Really?”<br />
          Korean person: “No, not really.”</p>
        <p>To distinguish that somebody is actually related to you by blood, they use the word “친동생”</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          저 사람은 저의 <strong>동생</strong>이에요 = That person is my <strong>younger sibling<br />
            동생</strong>은 왜 울었어요? = Why did your <strong>brother/sister</strong> cry?

      <h3><a name="me"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><u>How to say “I” or “me” in Korean</u></p>
      <p>First of all, I want to point out the difference between “I” and “me” in English. This is something that I
        never knew/realized until I started to learn Korean as you will find that learning a foreign language will
        vastly increase your understanding of your mother tongue and languages in general. In English “I” and “me” have
        the same meaning, but they differ in their usage. When the speaker is the subject of a sentence “I” is used.
        When the speaker is the object (or other part) of a sentence “me” is used. For example:</p>
      <p>I love you (“I” is the subject of the sentence)<br />
        You love me (“me” is the object of the sentence)</p>
      <p>In Korean, the same word is used to say “I” or “me.” That is, there is no difference in the Korean word if it
        used as a subject or object. However, remember that different <em>particles </em>will have to be attached to
        these words.</p>
      <p>Although the word in Korean for “I/me” doesn’t change based on its usage in a sentence, it <em>does</em> change
        based on the politeness of a sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>저 means “I/me” and is used in formal situations<br />
        나 means “I/me” and is used in informal situations</p>
      <p>~는 can be attached to 저 and 나 to indicate “I” is the subject of a sentence. For example:<br />
        저는<br />
        나는<br />
        <em>(I am purposely not providing example sentences because you still haven’t learned proper conjugations. You
          will finally learn about conjugations in this lesson)</em>
      </p>
      <p>~를 can be attached to 저 and 나 to indicate that “me” is the object of a sentence. For example:<br />
        저를<br />
        나를<br />
        <em>(I am purposely not providing example sentences because you still haven’t learned proper conjugations. You
          will finally learn about conjugations in this lesson)</em>
      </p>
      <p>~가 can be attached to 저 and 나 to indicate “I” is the subject of a sentence or clause. I have already briefly
        distinguished the difference between ~이/가 and ~은/는 in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-2/">Lesson 2</a>. The difference
        between these particles is very subtle and takes years to fully grasp. I discuss these differences more deeply
        in <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lesson 17</a> and <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-22/">Lesson 22</a> but this isn’t
        immediately important to you right now. What is immediately important to you is that you remember that when ~가
        is attached 나 changes to 내, and 저 changes to 제. For example:</p>
      <p>내가<br />
        제가<br />
        <em>(I am purposely not providing example sentences because you still haven’t learned proper conjugations. You
          will finally learn about conjugations in this lesson)</em>
      </p>
      <p>In the lesson below, all of the sentences are conjugated in an informal style. Therefore, all of the example
        sentences below use the informal “나” or “내.” In this lesson, don’t worry about formality and just focus on the
        information that I present. In the <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">next lesson</a>, you will
        learn more about formal and informal speech, and you will see “저” and “제” being used.</p>
      <h3><a name="you"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to say “you”</span></p>
      <p>You may have noticed that I still haven’t taught you one of those most common words in the English language. I
        know this sounds weird, but the word ‘you’ is not said very often in Korean. Korean people get around saying the
        word ‘you’ through a number of ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Most of the time, you use somebody’s (usually job) position when referring to them or talking about them.
          For example, boss (부장님), principal (교장선생님), vice principal (교감선생님), Mr. Name (for a teacher) (Name선생님),
          customer (고객님), guest (손님), 회장님/사장님 (president/CEO of a company).</li>
        <li>It is very common in Korean to refer to people that you are close with as your own family member. For
          example, 오빠 means “older brother” (when you are a woman). But even if somebody is not your older brother, you
          can call him ‘오빠’ if you are close to him.</li>
        <li>You can usually call any woman or man that looks very old “grandmother” and “grandfather” (할머니/할아버지). But
          other than that, you don’t really call somebody part of your family unless you are close with that person.
        </li>
        <li>You can generally call any strange man or woman that you don’t know ‘아저씨’ (man) and ‘아주머니’ (woman).</li>
        <li>In informal situations, you can use the word “너.” ~는 and ~를 can attach to “너” when “you” is the subject or
          object of a sentence, respectively. If ~가 is added to ~너, it changes to “네가.” In order to distinguish the
          pronunciation of “네가” and “내가” from each other (which, technically should be pronounced the same), “네가” is
          pronounced as “knee-ga.”</li>
        <li>You can also use the word “당신” which means “you.” You may use this word when talking to anybody, but Korean
          people hardly ever use it. Most people that say ‘당신’ are foreigners and only do so because they are so used to
          saying “you” in a sentence.</li>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic Conjugation: Past, Present, Future</span></p>
      <p>As I have mentioned in every lesson so far &#8211; every sentence that you have learned thus far has
        <strong><em>not</em> been conjugated</strong>. All the sentences you have learned so far would never actually be
        used in Korean because they are not conjugated. I felt you needed to know basic sentence structure before you
        learned how to conjugate. The good news, however, is that conjugating in Korean is much easier than other
        languages (including English and especially French!).
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An important note before you begin</span></p>
      <p>This lesson will show you how to conjugate past/present/future verbs in the <em>most basic way</em>. Although
        all of these conjugations are grammatically correct, they are rarely used in conversation. This form is
        sometimes called “diary form” because it is usually used when writing to yourself in a diary. It is also used
        when writing tests, books (not in dialogue), research papers, newspaper articles, magazine articles, and other
        times when one is not speaking/writing to a specific audience. It is also sometimes called the “plain form.”</p>
      <p>If you used this form in a sentence, you should use the informal &#8220;나,&#8221; as this conjugation is seen
        as informal. As such, throughout this lesson, you will see the word &#8220;나&#8221; used for &#8220;I.&#8221;
        However, as I mentioned, this conjugation form is also used in print (books, newspapers, articles, etc&#8230;).
        When this is done, the sentence is neither formal or informal &#8211; as it is just relaying facts. When used
        like this, no specific person is the speaker, and nobody is getting directly spoken to. Therefore, you
        don&#8217;t generally see &#8220;저&#8221; or &#8220;나&#8221; in these forms of Korean, and there is no need to
        see these writings as formal or informal.</p>
      <p>It is possible to use this &#8220;diary&#8221; or &#8220;plain&#8221; form in conversation, but you are more
        likely to hear one of the conjugations discussed in the <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">next lesson</a>. Although
        the plain form is not very common in conversation, the conjugation itself is <em>incredibly</em> important if
        you want to understand more complex grammar later on or learn to read most printed forms of Korean (books,
        newspaper, etc…). You will learn the most important conjugations for conversation in the next lesson, but I
        highly recommend you to understand the conjugations presented in this lesson first.</p>
      <p>The only part of speech that gets conjugated in Korean is verbs and adjectives (and 이다). As you already know, a
        sentence must end in either a verb or adjective or 이다.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at how to conjugate verbs and adjectives into the past, present and future tenses.</p>
      <h3><a name="vs"></a></h3>
      <h3><a name="vpres"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verb</span><em><span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span><br />
          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Present Tense</span></em></p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="center">When the last syllable of the stem ends in a consonant, you add ~는다 to
        the stem of the word:</p>
      <p>먹다 = 먹는다 = to eat (먹 + 는다)<br />
        닫다 = 닫는다 = to close (닫 + 는다)</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p>나는 문을 닫는다 = I close the door<br />
        나는 밥을 먹는다 = I eat rice</p>
      <p>When the last syllable of the stem ends in a vowel, you add ~ㄴto the last syllable followed by 다</p>
      <p>배우다 = 배운다 = to learn (배우 + ㄴ다)<br />
        이해하다 = 이해한다 = to understand (이해하 + ㄴ다)<br />
        가다 = 간다 = to go (가 + ㄴ다)</p>
      <p>Examples:<br />

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Past Tense</em></span></p>
      <p>Before you learn this, you need to know something important. Korean grammar is based on adding things directly
        to verbs or adjectives to create a specific meaning. For example, earlier in this lesson you saw how ~는다 or ~ㄴ다
        can be added to the stem of a verb in order to conjugate that verb to the present tense.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of grammatical principles (not just conjugations, but grammatical principles that have actual meanings
        in sentences) are created by adding certain things to the stems of verbs and adjectives. You will learn about
        these in later lessons as you progress through your studies. For example, the following is a short list of
        additions that can be added to the stems of verbs and/or adjectives to create a specific meaning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>~기 to create a noun form of a verb or adjective (<a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-29/">Lesson

        <li>~아/어야 하다 to indicate that one must do something (<a

            52</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The list could go on and on forever.</p>
      <p>Notice that some of these grammatical principles require the addition of “~아/어.” Many grammatical principles
        (or conjugations, or any other thing) require the addition of “~아/어” to the stem of a verb or adjective. Notice
        that the “slash” indicates that you need to <em>choose </em>what actually gets added to the stem. In some cases
        it is “~아”, and in some cases it is “~어”. The following is the rule that you can use to determine if you should
        add “~아” or “~어”:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the last vowel in a stem is ㅏ or ㅗ (this includes rare cases of the last vowel being ㅑ or ㅛ) you add ~아
          followed by the remainder of the grammatical principl<em>e. (The only exception is &#8220;</em>하.<em>&#8221;
            If the last syllable in a stem is &#8220;</em>하<em>&#8220;, ~</em>여<em> must be added to the stem followed
            by the remainder of the grammatical principle instead of</em> ~아.</li>
        <li>If the last vowel in a stem is anything but ㅏ or ㅗ you add ~어 followed by the remainder of the grammatical
          principle</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When conjugating to the past tense, we need to add “~았/었다” to the stem of a word (or 였다 in the case of 하다).
        Following the rule above, ~았다 is added to words with the last vowel being ㅗ or ㅏ and ~었다 is added to words with
        the last vowel being anything but ㅏ or ㅗ. Finally, ~였다 is added to words with the last syllable being
        &#8220;하.&#8221; For example:</p>
      <p>나는 밥을 먹다 = I eat rice (note that this sentence is <em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅓ. This is not ㅏ or ㅗ. So, we add 었다 to the stem:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-6-I-ate-rice.mp3">나는 밥을 먹었다</a> =
        I ate rice (먹 + 었다)
      </p>
      <p>나는 문을 닫다 = I close the door (note that this sentence is <em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅏ. So we add 았다 to the stem:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s4.mp3">나는 문을 닫았다</a> = I closed
        the door (닫 + 았다)
      </p>
      <p>나는 창문을 열다 = I open the window (note that this sentence is <em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅕ. This is not ㅏ or ㅗ. So we add 었다 to the stem:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s5.mp3">나는 창문을 열었다</a> = I opened
        the window (열 + 었다)
      </p>
      <p>나는 한국어를 공부하다 = I study Korean (note that this sentence is <em>unconjugated)<br />
        </em>The last syllable in the stem is &#8220;하&#8221;. Therefore, we add ~였다 to the stem:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s6.mp3">나는 한국어를 공부하였다</a> = I
        studied Korean (공부하 + 였다)
      </p>
      <p>What makes this complicated (at first) is that for verbs that have a last syllable that end in a vowel
        (including 하다), the ~았다/었다 gets merged to the actual stem itself. This is how ~아 and ~어 merge with syllables
        ending in a vowel:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>아 + 아 = 아 (example: 가 + 았다 = 갔다)</li>
        <li>오 + 아 = 와 (example: 오+ 았다 = 왔다)</li>
        <li>우 + 어 = 워 (example: 배우+ 었다 = 배웠다)</li>
        <li>이 + 어 = 여 (example: 끼+ 었다 = 꼈다)</li>
        <li>어 + 어 = 어 (example: 나서 + 었다 = 나섰다)</li>
        <li>여 + 어 = 여 (example: 켜다 + 었다 = 켰다)</li>
        <li>하 + 여 = 해 (example: 공부하다 + 였다 = 공부했다)<br />
          <em>Although </em>하 + 여<em> can be written as &#8220;</em>해<em>,&#8221; there will be some situations (usually
            official documents) where you will see “</em>하여<em>” used instead of “</em>해<em>.&#8221; This comes up a lot
            on <a href="https://youtu.be/s2chwbAsJHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">street signs</a>.<br />
          </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Words where the last vowel is “ㅡ” (for example: 잠그다) are complicated and will be covered in <a
            title="Lesson 7: Korean Irregulars"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-7/">Lesson 7</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <p>Many people have asked me “how do I merge ~아/어 to complex vowels like ㅠ, ㅑ, ㅔ, etc…?” You will find that the
        stem of almost all verbs and adjectives in Korean do not end in these complex vowels. The most common words I
        can think of that have stem that ends in one of these complex vowels are:</p>
      <p>바래다 (to fade)<br />
        매다 (to tie up)<br />
        메다 (to put on/carry something on one’s shoulder)</p>
      <p>With these words (and others like it), the same rule applies as above. That is, the final vowel does not end in
        ㅏ or ㅗ, so we need to add “어” plus whatever we are adding. With these complex vowels, it is irrelevant if you
        merge the addition to the stem. Both forms (merged and non-merged) would be correct.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p>바래 + 었다 = 바랬다 or 바래었다<br />
        매다 + 었다 = 맸다 or 매었다<br />
        메다 + 었다 = 멨다 or 메었다</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here is a more detailed breakdown:</p>
      <p>가다 = to go<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅏ. So we add 았다 to the stem.<br />
        나는 박물관에 가았다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 았다 can merge with 가:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s7.mp3">나는 박물관에 갔다</a> = I went to
        the museum
      </p>
      <p>오다 = to come<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅗ. So we add 았다 to the stem.<br />
        삼촌은 가게에 오았다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 았다 can merge with 오:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s8.mp3">삼촌은 가게에 왔다</a> = (My)
        uncle came to the store
      </p>
      <p>배우다 = to learn<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅜ. So we add 었다 to the stem.<br />
        오빠는 영어를 배우었다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 었다 can merge with 우:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s9.mp3">오빠는 영어를 배웠다</a> = (My)
        older brother learned English
      </p>
      <p>던지다 = to throw<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅣ. So we add 었다 to the stem.<br />
        나는 공을 던지었다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 었다 can merge with 지:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-8-I-threw-the-ball.mp3">나는 공을
          던졌다</a> = I threw the ball
      </p>
      <p>건너다 = to cross<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅓ. So we add 었다 to the stem.<br />
        나는 길을 건너었다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 었다 can merge with 너:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-9-I-crossed-the-street.mp3">나는 길을
          건넜다</a> = I crossed the street
      </p>
      <p>만나다 = to meet<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅏ. So we add 았다 to the stem.<br />
        나는 친구를 만나았다<br />
        But, because the stem ends in a vowel, 았다 can merge with 나:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-5-I-met-friends.mp3">나는 친구를
          만났다</a> = I met friends
      </p>
      <p>공부하다 = to study<br />
        The last vowel in the stem is 하. So, we add 였다 to the stem.<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s6.mp3">나는 한국어를 공부하였다</a><br />
        But, 하 and 여 can be merged to formed 해:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-7-I-studied-Korean.mp3">나는 한국어를
          공부했다</a> = I studied Korean
      </p>
      <h3><a name="vfut"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Future Tense</em></span></p>
      <p>Future tense is easy, and is simply a matter of adding “~겠다” to the stem of a word. Unlike the past and present
        tense conjugations, there is no difference if the stem ends in a vowel or a consonant. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 먹다 = I eat (<em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s10.mp3">나는 먹겠다</a> = I will eat
      </p>
      <p>나는 가다 = I go (<em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-11-I-will-go.mp3">나는 가겠다</a> = I
        will go
      </p>
      <p>나는 배우다 = I learn (<em>unconjugated)</em><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-10-I-will-learn.mp3">나는 배우겠다</a> =
        I will learn
      </p>
      <p>Two verbs specifically that are often conjugated in the future tense without actually having a meaning in the
        future tenses are 알다(to know) and 모르다(to not know). I don’t want to make any example sentences (because they
        would be too complicated at this point), but it would be good to remember that the words 알다 and 모르다 are often
        conjugated to 알겠다 or 모르겠다. Although they are conjugated to the future tense, those two words are typically used
        to express that somebody knows/doesn’t know something in the present tense.</p>
      <p>Also note that the ending of the conjugation will often change as well depending on the different honorifics
        that you will learn in the <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">next lesson</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>You learned previously that you need to add ~ㄴ/는다 to a verb stem in order to conjugate it in the present tense.
        In order to conjugate an adjective into the present tense you don’t need to do anything! Just leave the
        adjective as it is, and it is conjugated in the present tense. Some examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-teacher-is-beautiful.mp3">그 선생님은
          아름답다</a> = that teacher is beautiful<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-road-is-long.mp3">그 길은 길다</a> = that

      <h3><a name="apast"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Past tense</em></span></p>
      <p>In order to conjugate adjectives to the past tense, you must follow the same rule as when you conjugate verbs
        to the past tense. This rule, again, is:</p>
      <p>You must add 았다 or 었다 to the stem of a word. 았다 is added to words with the last vowel being ㅗ or ㅏ, and 었다 is
        added to words with the last vowel being anything but ㅏ or ㅗ. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-road-was-long.mp3">그 길은 길었다</a> =
        That street was long (길 + 었다)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-food-was-delicious.mp3">그 음식은 맛있었다</a>
        = That food was delicious (맛있 + 었다)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-teacher-was-good.mp3">그 선생님은 좋았다</a> =
        That teacher was good (좋 + 았다)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-13-That-restaurant-is-old.mp3">그
          식당이 오래되었다</a> = That restaurant is old*** (오래되 + 었다)
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p><em>The meaning of “</em>오래되다<em>” is not “old” in a bad, negative sense. Rather, it is indicating that
          something has existed for a long time, and now it is “old.” A more appropriate way to indicate that something
          is “old and decrepit” is to use the word “</em>낡다<em>”… not to be confused with the word “</em>늙다<em>”, which
          refers to an “old” person.</em></p>
      <p><em>This is a little bit complicated for you now, but although ~</em>었다<em> is attached to</em> 되<em> to make
          “</em>되었다<em>”, this can be contracted. Teaching this is not the focus of this lesson, so don’t worry about
          this for now. You will learn more about </em>되다<em> in future lessons. See <a
            title="Lesson 9: Conjugate 이다 (할 것이다)"

            14</a> for lessons nearby that discuss ‘</em>되다<em>.’</em></p>
      <p><em>Also, while </em>되다<em> is commonly used and conjugated as a verb, in this case, </em>오래되다<em> is an
          adjective. Which means that [in addition to other ways it will change when used with other grammatical
          principles], ~</em>ㄴ<em> can be added to it to describe an upcoming noun.</em></p>
      <p>For example: 우리는 오래된 집에 갔다 = We went to the old house</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just like with verbs, if the final letter of a verb/adjective stem is a vowel, ~았다/었다 can be merged to the
        actual stem itself:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/This-was-expensive.mp3">이것은 비쌌다</a> = This
        was expensive (비싸 + 았다)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-man-is-handsome.mp3">그 남자는 잘생겼다</a> =
        That man was handsome (잘생기 + 었다)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-person-was-fat.mp3">그 사람은 뚱뚱했다</a> =
        That person was fat (뚱뚱하 + 였다)

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Future tense</em></span></p>
      <p>Conjugating adjectives into the future tense is the same as conjugating verbs into the future tense. All you
        need to do is add 겠다 to the stem of the adjective:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-14-I-will-be-happy.mp3">나는
          행복하겠다</a> = I will be happy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-thing-is-delicious.mp3">그것은 맛있겠다</a> =
        That thing will be delicious<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-5-15-I-will-be-hungry.mp3">나는
          배고프겠다</a> = I will be hungry
      </p>
      <p>In general, not only is this basic form rare in conversation, but Korean people do not use adjectives in the
        future as often as English speakers.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conjugating </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">있다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">있다</span></p>
      <p>있다 is one of the most complex and versatile words in Korean. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most common
        words. It is often very difficult for learners of a language to fully understand some of the most commonly used
        words in whatever language they are studying. For example, a native English speaker might think that the word
        “the” is one of the easiest words as it is used so frequently. However, try explaining the meaning and purpose
        of “the” to a Korean person and you will quickly discover that its usage is very complex.</p>
      <p>있다 can be an adjective, or it can be a verb. Whether it is an adjective or a verb depends on its usage.</p>
      <p>있다 is an adjective when it is used to indicate that one “has” something. You learned these sentences in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-2/">Lesson 2</a>:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s11.mp3">나는 펜이 있다</a> = I have a
        pen<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s12.mp3">나는 차가 있다</a> = I have a
        car<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-5-s13.mp3">나는 가방이 있다</a> = I have a
        bag
      </p>
      <p>Because this 있다 is considered an adjective, we follow the rule for conjugating an adjective to the present
        tense – which is do nothing and leave the adjective the way it is. So, those three sentences above are perfectly
        conjugated and grammatically correct.</p>
      <p>When 있다 is used to indicate that something/someone is “at/in” a location, it is also an adjective. This is also
        very difficult for an English speaker to wrap their head around. You learned these sentences in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-2/">Lesson 2</a>:</p>
      <p>나는 은행 안에 있다 = I am inside the bank<br />
        개는 집 안에 있다 = The dog is in the house<br />
        고양이는 의자 밑에 있다 = The cat is under the chair</p>
      <p>Again, because this usage of 있다 is considered an adjective, we follow the rule for conjugating an adjective to
        the present tense – which is do nothing and leave the adjective the way it is. So, those three sentences above
        are perfectly conjugated in the plain form and grammatically correct.</p>
      <p>However, the usage of 있다 is much more complex than just these two meanings. 있다 has <em>many </em>usages. In
        fact, there are times when 있다 is considered a verb. At this point, your understanding of Korean is not strong
        enough to see example sentences of 있다 as a verb because you haven’t learned some critical grammatical principles
        yet. What I want you to take from this is that 있다 <em>can</em> be a verb – and thus – is conjugated as a verb
        sometimes. Therefore, although the example sentences above with 있다 are properly conjugated, there are times when
        the proper conjugation of 있다 in the “plain form” would be 있는다.</p>
      <p>있다 is considered a verb when a person (or animal) is not only “at” a location, but “staying” at a location or
        in a state for a period of time. The difference between the adjective “있다” (to indicate something/someone is at
        a location) and the verb “있다” (to indicate that someone stays at a location or in a state) is confusing.</p>
      <p>Below are some complicated ways that 있다 can be seen as a verb. You absolutely do not need to understand these
        now. I suggest that you worry about them when you reach that particular lesson in your studies:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>Wow, that is a lot of grammar. Understanding this will probably be your the hardest step you will need to make
        in learning Korean. I really mean that. If you can get through this lesson, almost everything you will learn
        will relate back to the principles in this lesson in one way or another. Don’t give up!</p>
