      <h3><a name="intro"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>In <a title="Lesson 1: Basic Korean Sentences"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-1/">Lesson 1</a> you learned
        about simple Korean particles. To review, you learned that:</p>
      <p>~는 or ~은 are used to indicate the subject (or main person/thing) in a sentence.<br />
        ~를 or ~을 are used to indicate the object in a sentence.</p>
      <p>For example, in this sentence: “I ate a hamburger”</p>
      <p>“I” is the subject of the sentence<br />
        “Hamburger” is the object<br />
        “Eat” is the verb</p>
      <p>In this Lesson, you will learn about the particles ~이/가 and specifically how it can compare with ~는/은. In all
        situations, ~이 is attached to nouns in which the last letter is a consonant (like ~은) and ~가 is attached to
        nouns in which the last letter is a vowel (like ~는). For example:</p>
      <p>책 ends in a consonant (ㄱ), so “~이” is added: &#8220;책이.&#8221;<br />
        소파 ends in a vowel (ㅏ), so “~가” is added: &#8220;소파가.&#8221;</p>
      <p>But, in what situations should we use ~이/가? Before we get to that, I would like to teach you how to use the
        word “있다” in sentences. Let’s get started.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="beat"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">있다: To have</span></p>
      <p>The word “있다” has many meanings. To a beginner of Korean, we can simplify and generalize these meanings into
        two forms or usages:</p>
      <p>있다 = to have<br />
        있다 = to be at a location</p>
      <p>Let’s talk about the first usage, “to have.” In English, “to have” is a verb that can act on an object. For
        example:</p>
      <p>I have a pen<br />
        I have a car</p>
      <p>This usage of 있다 in Korean is an <em>adjective. </em>This is hard for a learner to wrap their head around. At
        this point, this is important to you for one reason.</p>
      <p>You learned in <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-1/">Lesson
          1</a> that sentences with adjectives cannot act on an object. Thus, you <u>cannot</u> have a word with the
        particle ~을/를 attached to it if the predicating word in a sentence is an adjective (because ~을/를 indicates an
        object in a sentence).</p>
      <p>If this <em>weren’t</em> the case, we could do the following:</p>
      <p>I have a pen</p>
      <p>I 는 pen을 있다<br />
        나는 + 펜을 + 있다<br />
        나는 펜을 있다 = I have a pen</p>
      <p>However, the sentence above is incorrect. 있다 is an adjective and cannot act on an object like this. Therefore,
        the use of ~을 on “펜” is incorrect. To get around this, we can attach ~이/가 to the object instead of ~을/를 in
        sentences with 있다. This is <em>one </em>usage of the particle ~이/가; that is, to indicate the thing that a person
        “has” in sentences with “있다.” Look at the following example sentences:</p>
      <p>나는 펜이 있다 = I have a pen<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-2.mp3">나는 펜이 있어 / 저는 펜이 있어요</a>)
      </p>
      <p>나는 차가 있다 = I have a car<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-3.mp3">나는 차가 있어 / 저는 차가 있어요</a>)
      </p>
      <p>나는 잡지가 있다 = I have a magazine<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-4.mp3">나는 잡지가 있어 / 저는 잡지가
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>나는 가방이 있다 = I have a backpack<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-5.mp3">나는 가방이 있어 / 저는 가방이
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>Again, note that ~을/를 is not used to indicate the object that a person “has.” Instead, ~이/가 are used.</p>
      <p><span style="color: #993300;">Remember that the example sentences provided in Lessons 1, 2, 3 and 4 are <i>not
          </i>conjugated. While one/two forms of conjugations are provided in parentheses below each example sentence,
          the grammar within these conjugations is too complicated for you to understand right now. For now, focus on
          what is being presented in these first four lessons before you start to worry about conjugating sentences and
          using honorifics.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="new"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><u>Indicating a Place or Time: ~</u><u>에</u></p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-1/">previous
          lesson</a>, you learned how to use the particles ~은/는 and ~을/를 to denote the purpose of certain words in a
        Korean sentence. The particle ~에 is also used to denote certain words in a sentence. Specifically, ~에 denotes a
        place or time. When used to identify a place, it is similar to the underlined words in the English sentences
        below:</p>
      <p>I am <u>at</u> school<br />
        I went <u>to</u> the park<br />
        I put a sticker <u>on</u> the wall<br />
        I put water <u>into</u> the bottle<br />
        I put the baby <u>in</u> the crib</p>
      <p>~에 is also used to denote the time in which something happens. This is similar to the underlined words in the
        English sentences below:</p>
      <p>I ate breakfast <u>at</u> 10:00<br />
        I will go to school <u>on</u> Saturday<br />
        I was born <u>in</u> 1990</p>
      <p><em> </em><em>Yes, it is possible to have </em>~에 <em>used twice in a sentence. For example, the Korean
          translation of the sentence “I went to the park at 10:00” would have ~</em>에 <em>attached to the word “park”
          and “10:00.”</em></p>
      <p>It would be too much to discuss how ~에 can be used in all of these situations in this lesson. In this lesson
        (just below), you will learn how to use ~에 to indicate where one is – in order to create the sentence “I am
        <u>at</u> school” from above. In later lessons, as you learn more complex words and grammar, you will see how ~에
        can be used in the other situations. For example, in the next lesson we will introduce you to sentences that use
        ~에 to denote a place in which one goes to. In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>, you will see
        examples of sentences that use ~에 to denote that something happens at a particular time of the day. In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-8/">Lesson 8</a>, you will learn
        how to attach ~에 to days of the week. In later lessons, you will learn how to create all of the sentences shown
        above.
      </p>
      <p>For now, let’s focus on the sentence “I am at school,” which will require you to learn about 있다.</p>
      <h3><a name="beatt"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">있다: To be at a location</span></p>
      <p>있다 can also be used to indicate that something/someone is “at a location.” In the previous section of this
        lesson, you learned about the particle ~에 in Korean. You learned that this particle is used to indicate the
        place and/or time of something in a sentence. Therefore, “~에” is often used in sentences with “있다” to indicate
        the location of something/someone.</p>
      <p>For example: I am at school</p>
      <p>If we wanted to write this sentence with Korean structure and particles, we would write:</p>
      <p>I는 school에 am at<br />
        나는 + 학교에 + 있다</p>
      <p><em>This is irrelevant to you now, but when </em>있다<em> is used like this, it is again seen as an adjective.
          This is confusing, but for now, try to ignore it. I begin to discuss this more in <a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lesson 5</a> when I
          discuss the conjugations of </em>있다<em>.<br />
        </em></p>
      <p>나는 학교에 있다 = I am at school<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson2new9.mp3">나는 학교에 있어 / 저는 학교에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>or,</p>
      <p>나는 캐나다에 있다 = I am in Canada<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-1.mp3">나는 캐나다에 있어 / 저는 캐나다에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>Notice the very big difference in meaning between the following sentences, and the role that particles have in
        each case. Because 있다 has two different meanings, changing the particles in a sentence can drastically change
        the meaning. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 학교<strong>가</strong> 있다 = I have a school – this could make sense, but in most situations, you would
        probably want to say:<br />
        나는 학교<strong>에</strong> 있다 = I am at school</p>
      <p>나는 잡지가 있다 = I have a magazine<br />
        나는 잡지에 있다 = I am at the magazine (this doesn’t make sense)</p>
      <p>We can also use position words to indicate specifically where someone/something is with respect to another
        noun. The most common position words are:</p>
      <p>안 = inside<br />
        위 = on top<br />
        밑 = below<br />
        옆 = beside<br />
        뒤 = behind<br />
        앞 = in front</p>
      <p>These words are placed <strong>after</strong> a noun to indicate where an object is with respect to that noun.
        The particle “~에” is then attached directly to the position words. For example:</p>
      <p>학교 앞에 = in front of the school<br />
        사람 뒤에 = behind the person<br />
        집 옆에 = beside the house<br />
        저 건물 뒤에 = behind that building</p>
      <p>These constructions can now act as the location in a sentence:</p>
      <p>나는 학교에 있다 = I am at school</p>
      <p>나는 학교 <strong>앞에</strong> 있다 = I am in-front of the school<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-2-s1.mp3">나는 학교 앞에 있어</a> / <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-2-s2.mp3">저는 학교 앞에 있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>Let&#8217;s make some sentences:<br />
        나는 학교 뒤에 있다 = I am behind the school<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-6.mp3">나는 학교 뒤에 있어 / 저는 학교 뒤에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>나는 학교 옆에 있다 = I am beside the school<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-7.mp3">나는 학교 옆에 있어 / 저는 학교 옆에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>나는 은행 안에 있다 = I am inside the bank<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-8.mp3">나는 은행 안에 있어 / 저는 은행 안에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>개는 집 안에 있다 = The dog is in the house<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-9.mp3">개는 집 안에 있어 / 개는 집 안에
          있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>고양이는 의자 밑에 있다 = The cat is under the chair<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-2-10.mp3">고양이는 의자 밑에 있어 / 고양이는 의자
          밑에 있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>식당은 은행 옆에 있다 = The restaurant is next to the bank<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13.mp3">식당은 은행 옆에 있어 / 식당은 은행 옆에 있어요</a>)
      </p>
      <p>호텔은 학교 옆에 있다 = The hotel is next to the school<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14.mp3">호텔은 학교 옆에 있어 / 호텔은 학교 옆에 있어요</a>)
      </p>
      <p>You have learned that ~이/가 can be attached to nouns in sentences to indicate the object that a person “has.”
        ~이/가 can also be used to indicate the <i>subject</i> of a sentence, similar to ~는/은. What is the difference? We
        will talk about this in the next section.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="203"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">이</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">가 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">as a Subject
          Marker</span></p>
      <p>One of the most difficult things for a new learner of Korean to understand is the difference between the
        particles ~는/은 and ~이/가. Earlier in this Lesson, you learned that you should use ~이/가 on the object that a
        person “has” when using “있다.”</p>
      <p>In addition to this, there are more functions of ~이/가 that you should know about.</p>
      <p>In <a title="Lesson 1: Basic Korean Sentences"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-1/">Lesson 1</a>, you learned
        that you should add ~는/은 to the subject of the sentence. To use an example using the grammar taught earlier in
        this Lesson, you could say:</p>
      <p>고양이<b>는</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson2new11.mp3">고양이<b>는</b> 집 뒤에 있어 /
          고양이<b>는</b> 집 뒤에 있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>In this sentence, notice that the particle ~는/은 indicates that the “cat” is the subject.</p>
      <p>However the sentence above could <i>also</i> be written like this:</p>
      <p>고양이<b>가</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson2new10.mp3">고양이<b>가</b> 집 뒤에 있어 /
          고양이<b>가</b> 집 뒤에 있어요</a>)</p>
      <p>The two sentences <i>could </i>have exactly the same meaning and feeling. I emphasize “could” because in some
        situations the meaning of the two sentences is exactly the same, but in other situations the meaning of two
        sentences can be subtly different.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason why they could be identical:</span><br />
        고양이<b>는</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house<br />
        고양이<b>가</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house</p>
      <p>~이/가, like ~는/은, is added to the subject of the sentence. In some situations, there is no difference in meaning
        or feel between adding ~이/가 or ~는/은 to the subject.</p>

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason why they could be subtly different:</span><br />
        ~는/은 has a role of indicating that something is being compared with something else. The noun that “~는/은” is
        added to is being compared. In this example:</p>
      <p>고양이<b>는</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house</p>
      <p>The speaker is saying that <em>the cat </em>is behind the house (in comparison to something else that is not
        behind the house). The difficulty here is that there is only one sentence; which gives the listener no context
        to understand what “the cat” is being compared with. However, if I were to make up a context that fits into this
        situation, it could be that “The dog is in the house, and, <em>the cat</em> is behind the house.”</p>
      <p>However, saying:<br />
        고양이<b>가</b> 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house<br />
        …is simply stating a fact, and “the cat” is not being compared to anything.</p>
      <p>Another example:<br />
        커피가 냉장고에 있다 = The coffee is in the fridge (This sentence is simply stating that the coffee is in the fridge, and
        there is no intention of comparison)</p>
      <p>커피는 냉장고에 있다 = The coffee is in the fridge (This sentence could simply be stating that the coffee is in the
        fridge. It is also possible that the speaker is trying to distinguish between the location of another object.
        For example, perhaps the tea is on the table, but the <i>coffee </i>is in the fridge).</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p><em>You also might be wondering why &#8220;</em>안<em>&#8221; isn&#8217;t used if we are indicating that the
          coffee is </em><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span> the fridge. In cases like this, where
          the location being described happens to be &#8220;inside&#8221; of something, &#8220;</em>안<em>&#8221; can be
          omitted. You can see the similarities of using &#8220;</em>안<em>&#8221; and not using it in the following
          English and Korean sentences:</em></p>
      <p>커피가 냉장고에 있다 <em>= The coffee is in the fridge</em><br />
        커피가 냉장고 안에 있다 <em>= The coffee is inside the fridge</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>In both pairs of examples (using ~는/은 or ~이/가), the translation does not change by altering the subject
        particle. Rather, the only thing that changes is the subtle feeling or nuance that something is being compared.
      </p>
      <p>Note that this “comparative” function of ~는/은 can be used in much more complicated sentences, and can be
        attached to other grammatical principles – neither of which you have learned yet. In future lessons, not only
        will you see examples of increasing complexity applying this concept, but its usage with other grammatical
        principles will be introduced specifically. You need to remember that the example sentences given at this level
        are incredibly simple and do not really reflect actual sentences that you are likely to hear as one-off
        sentences from Korean people. Real speech is much more complex and it usually is an intricate combination of
        many clauses and grammatical principles.</p>
      <p>Our lessons don’t really get into the use of multiple clauses until <a
          title="Lesson 24: Before, After, Since, Within (전/후/이래로/이내)"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-24/">Lesson 24</a>. Creating
        sentences with more than one clause opens an entire other can of worms that you don’t have the tools to deal
        with yet. I encourage you to NOT read ahead to that lesson. Rather, I encourage you to keep the information from
        this lesson in mind as you eventually do reach that level.</p>
      <p>As you progress through our Lessons, you will see both “~는/은” and “~이/가” used as the subject particles in the
        thousands of example sentences we have provided. As almost all of our example sentences are just written as one
        sentence (without any background, prior context, or explanation of the situation), there is no way to tell if
        something is being compared to – and thus – their usage is usually arbitrary. That being said – every Korean
        example sentence throughout all of our lessons is always checked by a native Korean speaker to make sure that
        nothing is awkward (or incorrect).</p>
      <p>In addition to the distinction discussed in this lesson, there are other situations where it might be more
        appropriate to use ~이/가 or ~은/는. However, I am not able to fully describe the distinction between these two
        particles with the limited amount of grammar (and vocabulary) understanding you have to this point. The purpose
        of this lesson is to give you a general understanding of ~이/가, and to introduce you to the comparison between
        ~는/은.</p>
      <p>At this point, I would like you to continue to <a title="Lesson 3: Korean Verbs/Adjectives"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-3/">Lesson 3</a> to continue
        learning other grammatical principles you need to deepen your understanding of Korean in general.</p>
      <p>In <a title="Lesson 17: Connecting Particle ~고 and ~고 싶다 “I want to”"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lessons 17</a> and <a
          title="Lesson 22: Asking Questions in Korean: How, What, Which, How Many"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-22/">22</a>, we will come back to
        this problem and dive into more ways we can distinguish the functions of ~이/가 and ~는/은. I want to stress that I
        do not want you to read these now, but you should know that there is more to distinguishing ~는/은 and ~이/가 than
        is described here.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t reached <a title="Lesson 17: Connecting Particle ~고 and ~고 싶다 “I want to”"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lesson 17</a> (and especially
        if you haven’t even moved on to <a title="Lesson 3: Korean Verbs/Adjectives"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-3/">Lesson 3</a>) you won’t
        understand what is being described in that lesson. Being able to fully understand the difference between ~이/가
        and ~는/은 is important, but not as important (at the moment) as understanding other aspects of Korean grammar. I
        can’t stress this enough – your understanding of the difference between the two will progress with your Korean
        development in general.</p>
      <p>The good thing is, even if you make a mistake with the usages of ~이/가 and ~는/은 (either because you are confused
        or because you haven’t reached the later lessons yet), 99.9% of the time, the listener will be able to
        understand exactly what you are trying to express. Likewise, if you listen to somebody speaking, you will be
        able to understand what they are trying to say regardless of if you have learned the more complex usages of ~이/가
        and ~는/은. The difference between these two particles is about nuance and does not dramatically change the
        meaning of the sentence.</p>
      <p>Making a mistake between other particles, however, <em>would </em>cause other people to misunderstand you. For
        example, using ~를/을 instead of ~는/은 would (most likely) make your sentence incomprehensible.</p>
      <p>That’s it for this lesson. Please keep all of this information in your mind for future lessons. We will
        continue this discussion in <a title="Lesson 17: Connecting Particle ~고 and ~고 싶다 “I want to”"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-17/">Lesson 17</a>.</p>
      <p>For now, please continue to <a title="Lesson 3: Korean Verbs/Adjectives" href="../lessons/lesson3.html">Lesson
