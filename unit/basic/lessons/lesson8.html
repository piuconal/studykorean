          </strong>한국에서 <strong>대학교</strong>는 고등학교보다 덜 어려워요 = In Korea, <strong>University</strong> is not as hard as

          ago<br />
          <strong>대학교</strong>에 가고 싶다면 열심히 공부해야 해요 = If you want to go to <strong>university</strong>, you have to study

      <div id="target-id67835c2786afb" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes:<br />
          Korean pronunciation of the English word “truck”</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          그 고속도로에서 <strong>트럭</strong>을 운전해서는 안 돼요 = You must not drive a <strong>truck</strong> on that highway
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/vLesson-8-3.mp3">검은색</a> = <span
          class="collapseomatic noarrow" id="id67835c2786b13" tabindex="0" title="(the color) black">(the color)
          black</span>
      <div id="target-id67835c2786b13" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: This is a combination of the adjective “검다” (black) and “색” (color). Put together, the word is a noun
          that means “the color black,” but is often placed before nouns to describe them (like an adjective) anyways.
          Therefore, you can often see this (and other words of color) used before a noun to describe it and also at the
          end of a sentence (attached to 이다).</p>
        <p>When Korean people describe something by color in English, they will often say something like “I like the
          black-colored shirt.” This is the result of them directly translating “검은색 셔츠,” whereas in English we would
          just say “black shirt.”</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          At the end of a sentence: 저의 차는 <strong>검은색</strong>이에요 = My car is <strong>black<br />
          </strong><em>(Notice 이다 is used because 검은색 is a noun)</em></p>
        <p>Before a noun: 저는 <strong>검은색</strong> 차를 좋아해요 = I like <strong>black</strong> cars

          white</span>
      <div id="target-id67835c2786b2a" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes:<br />
          See “black” above. 흰색 is a combination of “희다” and “색”</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          <strong>흰색</strong> 셔츠를 입은 여자가 예뻐요 = The girl wearing the <strong>white</strong> shirt is pretty<br />
          <strong>흰색</strong> 구두를 신고 있다 = I am wearing <strong>white</strong> shoes/boots

      <div id="target-id67835c2786b40" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “음뇨수”</p>
        <p>Notes:<br />
          This is commonly used to refer to drinks like Coke, cider (which is similar to Sprite) and other carbonated
          beverages.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          <strong>음료수</strong>를 주문할래요? = Shall we order some <strong>drinks</strong>?<br />
          이 뷔페가격은 음료수를 포함해요 = This buffet price includes dinks

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Adverbs</span></p>
      <p>To this point, you have studied Korean verbs and adjectives in great depth, but you have yet to learn much
        about Korean adverbs. First of all, what is an adverb? Adverbs are words in sentences that tell you when, where,
        or to what degree something is being done.</p>
      <p>When: I went to work on <strong>Tuesday</strong><br />
        Where: I am <strong>inside</strong> the house<br />
        Degree: I opened the door <strong>quickly</strong></p>
      <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to use adverbs in Korean sentences. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>
      <h3><a name="whenwhere"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When and Where</span></p>
      <p>Anytime you put a word in a sentence that indicates when or where something is taking place, you must add the
        particle 에 to the end of that word. Keep in mind, however, that 에 is not the only particle that can go at the
        end of words of position or time. There are other particles that can go at the end of these words to indicate
        <em>from</em> when/where something occurred, <em>until</em> when/where, etc. For now, though, lets just talk
        about 에.
      </p>
      <p>This is very important. Even though all places (park, house, hospital, school, office, room, kitchen, etc.) are
        <em>also </em>nouns, when they are being talked about <strong>as a place</strong>, the particle 에 must be
        attached to them. Notice the difference between the following two sentences:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-1I-built-a-hospital.mp3">저는 병원을
          지었어요</a> = I built a hospital<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-2I-went-to-thea-hospital.mp3">저는
          병원에 갔어요</a> = I went to the/a hospital
      </p>
      <p>In the first sentence, “hospital” is the thing that you are building – so it is an object, which requires you
        to use the 을/를 particle.<br />
        In the second sentence, the hospital is the place in which you went to – so it is a place, which requires it to
        have the 에 particle.</p>
      <p>However, if you wanted to say <em>where </em>you built that hospital, you could say this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/1-I-built-a-hospital.mp3">저는 병원을 공원 옆에
          지었어요</a> = I built a hospital beside the park</p>
      <p>In addition to this, any word that indicates when something is taking place, needs to have the Korean particle
        에 attached to it. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2-I-will-go-on-Tuesday.mp3">저는 화요일에
          가겠어요</a> = I will go on Tuesday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/3-I-studied-in-the-evening.mp3">저는 저녁에
          공부했어요</a> = I studied in the evening<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-3I-built-a-hospital-beside-the-park-in-the-fall.mp3">저는
          가을에 공원 옆에 병원을 지었어요</a> = I built a hospital beside the park in the fall
      </p>
      <p>The best part about Korean adverbs is that they can essentially be placed at any place in the sentence. The
        only place they cannot be placed is at the end of the sentence &#8211; because a sentence must always end in an
        adjective or verb. They could even be placed at the beginning of a sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/5-I-will-study-in-the-summer.mp3">여름에 저는
          공부하겠어요</a> = I will study in the summer</p>
      <p>Korean people don’t add ~에 when using 오늘 (today), 내일 (tomorrow) and 어제 (yesterday):</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-8-s1.mp3">저는 한국에 오늘 도착했어요</a> = I
        arrived in Korea today<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-8-s2.mp3">저는 도서관에 어제 갔어요</a> = I
        went to the library yesterday<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-6-I-will-study-Korean-tomorrow.mp3">저는
          내일 한국어를 공부하겠어요</a> = I will study Korean tomorrow.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="degree"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To what degree/How much</span></p>
      <p>In addition to &#8220;when&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; adverbs, many adverbs can tell us to what degree
        something is being done. These adverbs usually (but not always) end in ‘ly’ in English:</p>
      <p>I ran <em>really quickly</em><br />
        I ate <em>fast</em><br />
        I left <em>immediately</em><br />
        I <em>often</em> meet my friend on Thursday<br />
        I eat <em>too much sometimes</em></p>
      <p>When adding these types of adverbs to sentences, no particle needs to be attached.<br />
        While other adverbs are generally free to be placed anywhere in a sentence, adverbs like this that indicate a
        degree to which something is done are typically placed immediately before the verb. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-4I-meet-my-friend-often.mp3">저는 저의
          친구를 자주 만나요</a> = I meet my friend often<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-5I-ate-a-lot-of-food-rice.mp3">저는
          밥을 많이 먹었어요</a> = I ate a lot of food (rice)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-6I-went-home-immediately.mp3">저는 집에
          바로 갔어요</a> = I went home immediately<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-7I-did-my-homework-quickly.mp3">저는
          숙제를 빨리 했어요</a> = I did my homework quickly
      </p>
      <p>Also, many of these words are just transferred from their adjective forms to create an adverb. This is done in
        English as well, for example:</p>
      <p>Quick -&gt; Quickly<br />
        Easy -&gt; Easily<br />
        Quiet -&gt; Quietly</p>
      <p>A lot of adverbs in Korean are simply made by adding ‘게’ to the stem of an adjective:</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163"><strong>Adjective</strong></td>
            <td valign="top" width="168"><strong>Adverb</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">쉽다 = easy</td>
            <td valign="top" width="168">쉽게 = easily</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">비슷하다 = similar</td>
            <td valign="top" width="168">비슷하게 = similarly</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">다르다 = different</td>
            <td valign="top" width="168">다르게 = differently</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Adjectives that end in 하다 are sometimes changed into adverbs by changing 하다 to 히. With most adjectives you can
        either add 게 to the stem or 히 with no difference in meaning. The only thing I can suggest is try to listen to
        which one is said in a specific situation, because even Korean people don’t know the answer to the question
        “what is the difference between 조용하게 and 조용히”:</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163"><strong>Adjective</strong></td>
            <td valign="top" width="240"><strong>Adverb</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">조용하다 = quiet</td>
            <td valign="top" width="240">조용하게/조용히 = quietly</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">안전하다 = safe</td>
            <td valign="top" width="240">안전하게/안전히 = safely</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Finally, some adjectives are changed into adverbs in a different way. When this happens, they are usually very
        similar to their original adjective form:</p>
      <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163"><strong>Adjective</strong></td>
            <td valign="top" width="240"><strong>Adverb</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">많다 = many</td>
            <td valign="top" width="240">많이 = many/a lot*</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" width="163">빠르다 = quick/fast</td>
            <td valign="top" width="240">빨리 = quickly</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>*많다/많이 essentially have the same meaning aside from the fact that one is an adverb and one is an adjective.
        Most of the time, the difference between the adjective and adverb form is very clear, but with 많이/많다, the
        meaning is similar. See the following:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-8I-ate-a-lot-of-rice.mp3">저는 많은 밥을
          먹었어요</a> = I ate a lot of rice<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-9I-ate-a-lot-of-rice.mp3">저는 밥을 많이
          먹었어요</a> = I ate a lot of rice.<br />
        Now that you know ALL that, using adverbs in sentences is easy as pie!:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-7-I-ate-quietly.mp3">저는 조용하게
          먹었어요</a> = I ate quietly<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-8-I-crossed-the-street-safely.mp3">저는
          거리를 안전하게 건넜어요</a> = I crossed the street safely<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/9-I-lived-happily.mp3">저는 행복하게 살았어요</a> = I
        lived happily
      </p>
      <p>You can, of course, use more than one adverb in a sentence. To look at the list I showed you earlier:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-10-I-ran-really-quickly.mp3">저는
          매우 빨리 달렸어요</a> = I ran really quickly<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-11-I-ate-fast.mp3">저는 빨리 먹었어요</a>
        = I ate fast<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-12-I-left-immediately.mp3">저는 바로
          떠났어요</a> = I left immediately<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-13-I-often-meet-my-friend-on-Thursday.mp3">저는
          저의 친구를 목요일에 자주 만나요</a> = I often meet my friend on Thursday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-14-I-eat-too-much-someitmes.mp3">저는
          가끔 너무 많이 먹어요</a> = I eat too much sometimes
      </p>
      <p>Though you can do that, using two adverbs that indicate the ‘degree of something’ is generally not done in
        Korean. For example, this would sound awkward:</p>
      <p>저는 거리를 쉽게 빨리 건넜어요 = I easily quickly crossed the street (It’s also awkward in English!)</p>
      <h3><a name="negsent"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negative Sentences</span></p>
      <p>There are two ways you can make a sentence negative:</p>
      <p>1. By adding 안, which acts as an adverb in the sentence. 안 is typically placed immediately before the final
        verb or adjective. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-10That-girl-isnt-pretty.mp3">그 여자는
          안 예뻐요</a> = That girl isn&#8217;t pretty<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-21-I-dont-like-fish.mp3">저는 생선을 안
          좋아해요</a> = I don’t like fish<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-19-Im-not-going-to-school-tomorrow.mp3">저는
          내일 학교에 안 가겠어요</a> = I’m not going to school tomorrow
      </p>
      <p>2. By adding ~지 않다 to the stem of the final verb or adjective. 않다 then becomes the verb or adjective in that
        sentence and must be conjugated accordingly. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-11That-girl-isnt-pretty.mp3">그 여자는
          예쁘지 않아요</a> = That girl isn&#8217;t pretty<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-22-I-dont-like-fish.mp3">저는 생선을
          좋아하지 않아요</a> = I don’t like fish<br />
        <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-20-Im-not-going-to-school-tomorrow.mp3">저는
          내일 학교에 가지 않겠어요</a> = I’m not going to school tomorrow
      </p>
      <p>Their respective meanings are identical. It is up to the speaker to decide which one will be used. There are
        times when it will be more natural to use &#8220;안&#8221; and there will be times when it will be more natural
        to use &#8220;~지 않다.&#8221; At this point, you can consider them the same. Throughout your studies you will
        constantly be exposed to 안 and ~지 않다, and through this exposure you can gradually develop a preference for which
        one should be used and in which circumstance.</p>
      <p>I like to share my observations that I have made through my experiences with the Korean language. I think this
        can be helpful to learners as they struggle to understand when to use some grammatical principles over others.
        There are a few things I would like to talk about regarding these negative sentences.</p>
      <hr />
      <p>As you know, most verbs ending in ~하다 can be turned into a noun-form of that verb by removing ~하다. For example:
      </p>
      <p>공부하다 = to study<br />
        공부 = the noun form of &#8220;study&#8221;</p>
      <p>실수하다 = to make a mistake<br />
        실수 = a mistake</p>
      <p>여행하다 = to travel<br />
        여행 = a trip</p>
      <p>When indicating that one &#8220;does not do&#8221; a ~하다 verb, it is common to separate ~하다 from the noun and
        place &#8220;안&#8221; in between them. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent7.mp3">저는 공부를 안 했어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t study<br />
        Instead of:<br />
        저는 안 공부했어요</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent8.mp3">저는 실수를 안 했어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t make (do) a mistake<br />
        Instead of:<br />
        저는 안 실수했어요</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent.mp3">저는 여행을 안 했어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t travel<br />
        Instead of:<br />
        저는 안 여행했어요</p>
      <p>It would also be appropriate to use the ~지 않다 form with these words. However, in these cases, it doesn&#8217;t
        matter if the noun is separated from ~하다 or not. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-16-I-didnt-study.mp3">저는 공부하지
          않았어요</a> = I didn’t study<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent2.mp3">저는 공부를 하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn’t study
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent3.mp3">저는 실수하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t make a mistake<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent4.mp3">저는 실수를 하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t make a mistake
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent5.mp3">저는 여행하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t travel<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent6.mp3">저는 여행을 하지 않았어요</a> = I
        didn&#8217;t travel
      </p>
      <p>Many adjectives end in ~하다. It is unnatural to remove the ~하다 in these words and place &#8220;안&#8221; between
        them. You can&#8217;t separate an adjective and &#8220;act&#8221; on it with ~하다 because they are adjectives.
        For example, the following would be incorrect:</p>
      <p>저는 행복을 안 해요 (This does not mean &#8220;I am not happy&#8221;)</p>
      <p>However, you could use ~지 않다 on a -하다 adjective or place &#8220;안&#8221; before the verb without separating it.
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent1.mp3">저는 안 행복해요</a> = I am
        not happy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-8-18-Im-not-happy.mp3">저는 행복하지
          않아요</a> = I am not happy
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>I have had people ask me about the word order of sentences using an adverb <em>and </em>the negative adverb
        “안”. One learner asked me if this sentence would be okay:</p>
      <p>저는 빨리 안 공부했어요</p>
      <p>While it might be understood, this sentence sounds very awkward in Korean. The reason is probably due to the
        fact that there are two adverbs being used. In this sentence, both “빨리” and “안” act as adverbs that indicate the
        degree to which the studying was done. As I mentioned earlier, this usually isn’t done in Korean. Instead, if
        you wanted to express that meaning, you can use the ~지않다 negative addition instead. By doing this, you
        effectively remove one of the adverbs and are left with:</p>
      <p>저는 빨리 공부하지 않았어요 = I didn’t study quickly</p>
      <p>Even still, though. This sentence could still be a little awkward in Korean – because when would you ever say
        “I didn’t study quickly”? In most cases, it would be more natural to simply use an adverb that has the opposite
        meaning. For example, this sentence:</p>
      <p>저는 밥을 빨리 먹지 않았어요 = I didn’t eat (rice) quickly</p>
      <p>Would be more naturally said as:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-12I-ate-rice-slowly.mp3">저는 밥을 천천히
          먹었어요</a>= I ate rice slowly</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="아니다"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To not be: 아니다</span></p>
      <p>아니다 (to not be) is the opposite of the word 이다 (to be), but they are used a little bit differently. Remember
        that 이다 is always attached directly to a noun. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 선생님이다 = I am a teacher<br />
        나는 대학생이다 = I am a university student</p>
      <p>However, when using 아니다, the particle ~이/가 is attached to the noun, and 아니다 is used as a separate word:</p>
      <p>나는 선생님이 아니다 = I am not a teacher<br />
        나는 대학생이 아니다 = I am not a university student</p>
      <p>Below are some examples, with possible conjugations of 아니다. You have learned how to conjugate verbs and
        adjectives, but you still haven&#8217;t learned how to conjugate 이다 and 아니다. You will learn this in <a

      <p>나는 선생님이 아니다 = I am not a teacher<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-13I-am-not-a-teacher.mp3">저는 선생님이
          아니에요</a>)</p>
      <p>나는 너의 친구가 아니다 = I am not your friend<br />

      <p>나는 대학생이 아니다 = I am not a University Student<br />

      <h3><a name="없다"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To not have: 없다</span></p>
      <p>Just like how 아니다 is the opposite of 이다 &#8211; 없다 is the opposite of 있다. In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lesson 5</a>, you learned
        some ways to use 있다. 없다 can indicate that one &#8220;does not have&#8221; something or that something
        &#8220;wasn&#8217;t at a particular location.&#8221; For example:</p>
      <p>To not have:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/25-I-dont-have-money.mp3">저는 돈이 없어요</a> = I
        don’t have money<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/26-I-dont-have-time.mp3">저는 시간이 없어요</a> = I
        don’t have time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-16We-dont-have-a-car.mp3">우리는 차가
          없어요</a> = We don&#8217;t have a car
      </p>
      <p>To not be in a location:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/27-My-friend-is-not-in-Korea-now.mp3">저의
          친구는 지금 한국에 없어요</a> = My friend is not in Korea now<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/28-There-was-nobody-there.mp3">사람이 없었어요</a>
        = There was no people
      </p>
      <h3><a name="ONW"></a></h3>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To not like: 싫어하다 and 싫다</span></p>
      <p>While we are talking about negative words, I want to talk about 싫어하다 quickly. &#8220;싫어하다&#8221; is a verb that
        is used to indicate that one dislikes something. 싫어하다 is the opposite of 좋아하다 (to like). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/29-I-dislike-fruit.mp3">저는 과일을 싫어해요</a> =
        I dislike fruit<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lesson8nnsent9.mp3">저는 과일을 좋아해요</a> = I
        like fruit
      </p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-3/">Lesson 3</a>, you
        learned how 좋다 and 좋아하다 are different. I explained that 좋다 is an adjective (meaning &#8220;to be good&#8221;),
        and thus cannot act on an object. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/That-teacher-is-good.mp3">그 선생님은 좋다</a> =
        That teacher is good<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22.mp3">이 학교는 좋다</a> = This school is good
      </p>
      <p>The adjective form of 싫어하다 is 싫다. However, contrary to what you probably expect, 싫다 is not used to mean
        &#8220;to not be good.&#8221; In order to indicate that something is &#8220;not good&#8221; (i.e.
        &#8220;bad&#8221;), the adjective 나쁘다 is commonly used. Instead, 싫다 is often used to indicate that one dislikes
        something (just like 싫어하다). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson8-18I-dislike-fruit.mp3">저는 과일이
          싫어요</a> = I dislike fruit</p>
      <p>Notice that because 싫다 is an adjective, it cannot act on an object, so the particles ~이/가 are attached to the
        noun. This type of sentence is a little bit too complex right now, so I don&#8217;t want to dig too deep into
        it. I discuss this more deeply in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-15/">Lesson 15</a>.</p>
      <p>Be careful to not make double negative sentences. Although technically grammatically correct, this one reads
        funny:</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">저는 과일을 싫어하지 않아요 = I don’t dislike fruit</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="center">That&#8217;s it for this lesson!</p>
