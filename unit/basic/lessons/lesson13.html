        <p>Notes: There are many adverbs that are used in specific situations to give a sentence feel or emphasis. To
          indicate that one “sprang” up, the adverb 벌떡 can be used.</p>
        <p>일어나다 literally means “to get up” from a sitting/laying position to a standing position. However, it is often
          used to indicate that one “wakes up” because one usually “gets up” from bed when they wake up. As such, the
          translation of “일어나다” could be “to get up” or “to wake up” depending on the situation. You can this in the
          examples below:</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          언제 <strong>일어났어요</strong><strong>?</strong> = When did you <strong>get up?<br />
          </strong>군인들은 매일 일찍 <strong>일어나</strong>야 돼요 = Soldiers have to <strong>wake up</strong> early every day<br />
          그녀는 의자에서 <strong>일어났어요</strong> = She <strong>rose up</strong> from her chair<br />
          저는 아침에 일찍 <strong>일어났어요</strong> = I <strong>woke</strong> <strong>up</strong> early in the morning<br />
          우리는 내일 일찍 <strong>일어나</strong>야 돼요 = We need to <strong>wake up</strong> early tomorrow morning

      <div id="target-id6783cec9e174c" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “늗따”</p>
        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          늦게까지 = until a late time</p>
        <p>This is often irrelevant, but 늦다 is both a verb and an adjective. As a verb, it usually indicates that one
          <em>arrives</em> late. For example:
        </p>
        <p>우리가 <strong>늦</strong>어서 죄송해요 = Sorry we arrived <strong>late</strong><strong><br />
          </strong></p>
        <p>It is often used as an adjective to describe a time that is late. For example:</p>
        <p>우리는 늦은 저녁을 먹었어요 = We ate a <strong>late</strong> dinner</p>
        <p>As an adjective, ~게 is often added to it in order to create an adverb. For example:</p>
        <p>그녀는 언제나 <strong>늦</strong>게 와요 = She comes <strong>late</strong> every time<br />
          저는 <strong>늦</strong>게 도착했어요 = I arrived <strong>late</strong></p>
        <p>Usually, adverbs like this end in “-ly,” however, “lately” is unnatural in these English sentences. Korean
          people often incorrectly use the word “lately” because of this confusion.</p>
        <p>Again, the fact that it can be an adjective or a verb is usually irrelevant. The only thing that matters is
          that it can be conjugated correctly to 늦다 (as an adjective) <em>or </em>늦는다 (as a verb).

      <p>In the last lesson, you learned some important Korean particles that you can use in a wide variety of
        situations. There are still a few more basic particles that you need to be aware of before you can begin
        learning more complex grammar. Most of these particles are very common, so it is hard to build sentences using
        more complex grammar without the use of what you learned in <a
          title="Lesson 12: Korean Particles 들, only, from, 부터/까지, (으)로"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-12/">Lesson 12</a>, and what you will
        learn in this lesson. Let’s get started!</p>
      <h3><a name="kp1"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particles (and): ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">과</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">와</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">랑</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">이랑</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하고</span></p>
      <p>~과/와, ~랑/이랑 and ~하고 can all be used interchangeably to mean “and” in Korean.<br />
        ~과 and ~와 are the same. ~과 is attached to words ending in a consonant, ~와 is attached to words ending in a
        vowel. Similarly, ~랑 and ~이랑 are the same. ~이랑 is attached to words ending in a consonant, ~랑 is attached to
        words ending in a vowel. ~하고 can be attached to words ending in a vowel or consonant. These can be added fairly
        simply to nouns. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-1.mp3">우리는 밥과 빵을
          팔아요</a> = We sell rice and bread<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.mp3">나는 사과와 바나나를 샀어</a> = I bought apples
        and bananas
      </p>
      <p>The two examples above show ~와/과/랑/이랑/하고 placed between two nouns that together act as the object of the
        sentence. Notice that although there are two nouns, both of them (together) sort of act as the single object of
        the sentence.</p>
      <p>Other particles can attach to the construction made by using ~와/과/랑/이랑/하고 as well. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-2.mp3">나는 인천이랑 서울에 갈
          거야</a> = I will go to Seoul and Incheon<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/4.mp3">형하고 아버지는 영화를 봤어</a> = My brother and
        dad saw a movie<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-3.mp3">저는 약과 녹차만 샀어요</a>
        = I only bought medicine and green tea
      </p>

      <h3><a name="kp2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particles (with): ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">과</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">와</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">랑</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">이랑</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">하고</span></p>
      <p>Just when you thought this was going to be an easy lesson! Ha! This sounds crazy to an English speaker, but the
        same particles are used to mean “and” and “with” in Korean. You can distinguish them purely by the context of
        the conversation, which sounds like it would be difficult. However, even though you probably think it is
        difficult, it is always clear (even to a beginner) if the speaker is trying to express the meaning of “and” or
        “with” because of the sentence structure.</p>
      <p>For example, when used to have the meaning of “and,” a noun will always follow 과/와/(이)랑/하고: For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2.mp3">나는 사과와 바나나를 샀어</a> = I bought
        apples and bananas</p>
      <p>After 와, another noun is used, which means you are talking about apples AND bananas. But if I said this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/7.mp3">나는 친구와 갔어</a> = I went with my
        friend<br />
        There is no additional noun after 와, which means it can only mean “with.” If ~와in that sentence had the meaning
        of “and”, it would translate to:</p>
      <p>I went, my friend and…<br />
        … which is just nonsense</p>
      <p>Here are some examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-4.mp3">저는 친구와 집에
          갔어요</a> = I went home with my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/9.mp3">나는 아버지랑 공원에 갈 거야</a> = I will go to
        the park with my dad<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10.mp3">선생님은 학생들과 박물관에 갔다</a> = The teacher
        went to the museum with the students<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-5.mp3">요즘에 사람들이 친구들이랑 매운
          음식을 먹지 않아요</a> = These days, people don’t eat spicy food with their friends
      </p>
      <p>Also notice that you can actually use these particles to mean both “and” and “with” within the same sentence:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/12.mp3">저는 밥을 친구랑 저의 어머니랑 먹었어요</a> = I ate
        (rice*) with my mom and my friend<br />
        <em>*Korean people often use “</em>밥<em>” (rice) to simply mean “food.” It stems from the fact that Korean
          people eat rice with (almost) every meal – so if you ate, it means that you ate rice. You can say “</em>밥을
        먹었어<em>” which can simply mean “I ate.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>Two adverbs that are commonly used in sentences with “with” are 같이 and 함께. Both of them mean “together,” and
        can be used in sentences even if the sentence doesn’t have one of the particles meaning “with” (과/와/랑/이랑/하고).
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-6.mp3">우리는 빵을 같이
          먹었어요</a> = We ate bread together<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-7.mp3">우리는 빵을 함께
          먹었어요</a> = We ate bread together
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-8.mp3">우리는 집에 같이
          들어갔어요</a> = We went into the house together<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-9.mp3">우리는 집에 함께
          들어갔어요</a> = We went into the house together
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-10.mp3">우리는 음악을 같이
          들었어요</a> = We listened to music together<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-11.mp3">우리는 음악을 함께
          들었어요</a> = We listened to music together
      </p>
      <p>The use of the word “together” in the same sentence as the word “with” in English is usually unnatural. For
        example, it sounds unnatural for me to say something like this:</p>
      <p>I ate bread together with a friend</p>
      <p>Instead, in English, we would say one of the following sentences:</p>
      <p>I ate bread with a friend<br />
        We ate bread together</p>
      <p>In Korean however, it is okay to use 같이 or 함께 in either of these situations; that is – with the word “with” in
        the sentence, or without it. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-12.mp3">저는 빵을 친구랑 같이
          먹었어요</a> = I ate bread with a friend (together)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-13.mp3">저는 빵을 친구와* 함께
          먹었어요</a> = I ate bread with a friend (together)
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-14.mp3">저는 빵을 친구랑
          먹었어요</a> = I ate bread with a friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-15.mp3">저는 빵을 친구와
          먹었어요</a> = I ate bread with a friend<br />
        <em>Notice that I used </em>~와 <em>with </em>함께 <em>instead of</em> ~랑<em>. Just like with the meaning of “and,”
        </em>“~와/과<em>” is more likely to be used in writing and in formal situations, whereas “</em>~(이)랑<em>” is more
          likely to be used is speech. This entirely depends on the person who is speaking/writing, but it is generally
          true. Likewise, the use of “</em>함께<em>” is generally used in writing and formal situations. Therefore, the
          use of </em>함께<em> is more likely to be paired with ~</em>과/와<em> in these cases.</em>
      </p>
      <p><em>To add an additional level of complexity to this explanation – </em>같이 <em>is more commonly used than
        </em>함께 (같이<em> is probably one of the most common words in Korean, while </em>함께<em> would fall much further
          down the list). However, when </em>함께<em> is used, it is more likely to be used with ~</em>과/와<em>. These are
          just generalizations based on observations of years of speaking with Korean people.</em></p>
      <p>More examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-16.mp3">저는 녹차를 엄마랑 같이
          마셨어요</a> = I drank green tea with my mom<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-17.mp3">저는 엄마랑 유명한 영화를
          같이 봤어요</a> = I saw/watched a famous movie with my mom
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/25.mp3">저는 선생님과 함께 공부했어요</a> = I studied
        with my teacher<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-18.mp3">저는 여자 친구와 함께 영화를
          봤어요</a> = I watched a movie with my girlfriend
      </p>
      <p>You can also use these particles to say that you are simply ‘with’ somebody in a location. In order to do this,
        you must use 있다 along with one of the adverbs meaning “together”. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-19.mp3">나는 친구랑 같이
          있어</a> = I’m with my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-20.mp3">저는 친구와 집에 함께
          있어요</a> = I’m with a friend at home
      </p>
      <p><em>Note that this meaning of “with” in Korean cannot be used like this:<br />
          I built a house <strong>with </strong>my hands</em><em><br />
          Remember, “my hands” are the method by which you did something, so</em><em>, as you learned in <a
            title="Lesson 12: Korean Particles 들, only, from, 부터/까지, (으)로"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-12/">Lesson 12 </a></em>~(으)로<em>
          should be used in those situations</em><em>. For example:</em></p>
      <p>저는 손으로 집을 지었어요</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="kp3"></a></h3>

          style="text-decoration: underline;">한테</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">께</span></p>
      <p>These three particles can all be used to indicate that you are doing (usually giving) something TO somebody.
        에게, 한테 and 께 all have the same meaning, but ~한테 is usually used in conversation, ~에게 is usually written
        (although it is still said in conversation very often) and ~께 is used when the person you are giving something
        to requires respect (께 is the honorific form of 에게/한테).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/29.mp3">아버지는 아들에게 돈을 준다</a> = The father
        gives money to his son<br />

        = I will tell that (fact) to my boss
      </p>
      <p><em>In the sentence above using ~</em>께<em>, a different verb (</em>말씀<em>) and grammatical form (</em>드리다<em>)
          would more likely be used to conjugate the sentence. At this point, you haven&#8217;t learned either of those
          words (or how they are used), so I refrained from using them in this example. These will be introduced in <a

      <p>Note that just because you use ~께 doesn’t mean that your sentence needs to end in a polite way. ~께 is used when
        the person who is being given to is of high importance, regardless of who you are talking to. For example, if I
        was a teacher, talking to my student, talking about something being given TO the principal, I could say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/32.mp3">나는 책을 교장선생님께 줬어</a> = I gave the
        principal a book</p>
      <p><i>Again, the word </i><i>“</i>드리다<i>” would most likely be used instead of </i>주다 <em>here</em><i>. For now,

          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-12/">Lesson 12</a> that ~에서 can be
        used to mean “from” in a wide variety of situations. ~에게서/한테서 can also have the translation of “from,” but they
        are used in a more restricted way.</p>
      <p>~에게서/한테서 has the meaning that is opposite of ~에게/한테/께, which means it is used when somebody receives something
        from somebody. These particles are attached to the person from whom one receives something. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/33.mp3">나는 나의 여자친구에게서 편지를 받았어</a> = I
        received a letter from my girlfriend</p>
      <p>The “thing” that is being received doesn’t need to be something physical. It could be something abstract like
        stories, explanations, or other things. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-13-s2.mp3">저는 교감선생님에게서 한국어를

        heard that from my friend
      </p>
      <p>A very similar particle is ~(으)로부터. This particle can also be attached to the person from whom one receives
        something. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-22.mp3">나는 나의 여자친구로부터

      </p>
      <p>~(으)로부터 can also be used when receiving something from a non-person thing (a company/the government/etc). For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/41.mp3">나는 돈을 정부로부터 받았어</a> = I received
        money from the government<br />

          받았어요</a> = I received this from the sky (heavens)
      </p>
      <p>However, you cannot use ~에게서/~한테서 to indicate that you received something from a non-person.</p>
      <p>To summarize, ~(으)로부터 can be used to indicate that one receives something from a person or non-person. ~에게서 and
        ~한테서 have a similar meaning, but can only be used when one receives something from a person.</p>
      <h3><a name="kp5"></a></h3>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do something for somebody: ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">을</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span

          style="text-decoration: underline;">(</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">서</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p>If you want to say that you are doing something FOR (the benefit of) somebody, you can add ~를/을 to the person
        who you are doing something for, followed by 위해(서):</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/43.mp3">나는 나의 여자 친구를 위해(서) 꽃을 샀어</a> = I

          준비했어요</a> = I prepared cool water for my father
      </p>
      <p>There doesn’t seem to be a difference between 위해 and 위해서.</p>
      <p>This form is usually used when you are doing something for a person, but can also be used sometimes when you
        are doing something for a non-person:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/47.mp3">저는 회사를 위해 열심히 일할 거예요</a> = I will
        work hard for the company</p>
      <p>The important thing is that the thing for which you are doing something must be a noun. You <em>can</em> use 위해
        to indicate that you are doing something for the purpose of a <em>verb</em> (I am going there <strong>to/for the
          purpose of </strong>see(<strong>ing)</strong> a movie) but you will learn about that in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-32/">Lesson
          32</a> once you have learned how to change verbs into nouns.</p>
      <p>Also make sure that you realize that ‘for’ can have many meanings in English. Just because you say ‘for’ in
        English, doesn’t mean that it can be translated directly to ~를/을 위해. In Korean, ~를/을 위해 means <strong>for the
          benefit of. </strong>For example, in this sentence:</p>
      <p>I am waiting for the bus – the ‘bus’ is the object which you are waiting for, so, in Korean, you attach the
        particle ~을/를 to ‘bus’ but not ~을/를 위해:</p>
      <p>나는 버스를 기다린다</p>
      <p>This isn&#8217;t incredibly important right now, but I thought I&#8217;d mention it. &#8220;위해&#8221; is
        actually a verb, and the base form of the verb is 위하다. When ~아/어/여 is added to 위하다, it changes to 위하여. This was
        first presented in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/#vpast">Lesson 5.</a> 하다
        officially changes to 하여 when adding ~아/어/여, but this is commonly shortened to 해. Therefore, it is possible to
        use &#8220;위하여&#8221; instead of &#8220;위해.&#8221; Technically, this is possible in any word that finishes in
        ~하다, but it seems to be much more common with 위하다 than any other verb or adjective.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMRfpE9JdUo">Here is a Korean sign that shows ~을/를 위하여, and my
          explanation of it.</a></p>
      <h3><a name="kp6"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">About something ~에</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"> 대해</span></p>
      <p>~에 대해 can also be attached to nouns like 를/을 위해, but this has the meaning of “about.” It’s very easy to
        understand when used in simple situations:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-30.mp3">나는 너에 대해
          생각했어</a> = I thought about you<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-31.mp3">나는 나의 아버지에 대해
          말했어</a> = I spoke about my father<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/50.mp3">나는 그것에 대해 책을 쓸 거야</a> = I will
        write a book about it<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-13-sentence-32.mp3">그 회계사는 정부에 대해 나쁜
          말을 했어요</a> = That accountant said bad things about the government
      </p>
      <p>Just like with ~을/를 위해서, there is very little (if any) difference between ~에 대해 and ~에 대해서. For example, the
        sentences above could all be written as:</p>
      <p>나는 너에 대해서 생각했어 = I thought about you<br />
        나는 나의 아버지에 대해서 말했어 = I spoke about my father<br />
        나는 그것에 대해서 책을 쓸 거야 = I will write a book about it<br />
        그 회계사는 정부에 대해서 나쁜 말을 했어요 = That accountant said bad things about the government</p>
      <p>One way that you cannot use ~에 대해 is in the following sentence:</p>
      <p>My favorite thing <strong>about</strong> you is your eyes.</p>
      <p>I’d love to teach you that sentence in Korean, even though we haven&#8217;t covered the grammar, Ah, what the
        heck – I’ll show you – even though full understanding won&#8217;t come until <a

      <p>That&#8217;s it for this lesson! I think this one was one of the easiest lessons yet&#8230; haha, what do you
        think? Simple memorizing &#8211; nothing too complicated. In the next lesson, we will be talking about something
        native speakers of any language never think about when they speak&#8230; which means it is going to be hard to
        grasp! Think of this lesson as a gift from me to relax your brain before you start to get confused again!</p>
