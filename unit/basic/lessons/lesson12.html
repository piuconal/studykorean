        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “닥”<br />
          Typically, the pronunciation of words with four-letter syllables merge with the pronunciation of an attaching
          grammatical principle. For example, “값” is pronounced as “kap” but 값을 is pronounced as “갑슬.” However, the ㄹ in
          닭 is usually not pronounced in these cases. For example, 닭을 is usually pronounced as “닥을” or “다글” and 닭이 is
          usually pronounced as “다기” or “닥이.”</p>

          닭갈비 = chicken ribs<br />
          닭살 = goose-bumps</p>

        <p>Notes: 쪽 is a noun, but a special noun. I refer to these sometimes as &#8220;pseudo-nouns&#8221; in my
          lessons. Other nouns like this are 적 (<a

        <p>You can see that if you describe it using the concepts in <a

        <p>저는 다른 사람들이 가는 쪽으로 갈 거예요 = I will go in the direction that other people are going</p>
        <p>Or, you can place a noun immediately before it:</p>
        <p>저는 학교 쪽으로 갈 거예요 = I will go in the direction of school</p>
        <p>Common things that 쪽 is placed after are words on their own. Similar how 이 것, 그 것 and 저 것 are actually words
          as 이것, 그것 and 저것. For example:</p>
        <p>이쪽 = towards this direction<br />
          그쪽 = towards that direction<br />
          저쪽 = towards that direction<br />
          오른쪽 = to the right<br />
          왼쪽 = to the left<br />
          안쪽 = towards the inside</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>As of now, you have learned a few different Korean particles. The particles you have learned so far are: 는/은,
        이/가, 를/을, 의 and 도. There are many more particles that you will need to learn – and this lesson will cover a lot
        of them. In this lesson, you will learn about ~들, ~만, ~에서, ~부터, ~까지 and ~(으)로! Let’s get started!</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Important Note: Eliminating the Subject<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>One thing that I have yet to tell you is that Korean people often omit the topic/subject of the sentence –
        especially when the topic/subject is ‘I.’ Korean people love making their sentences as short as possible, and
        this is one additional way of doing it. In most cases, when the subject/topic can be inferred by the situation,
        Korean people drop it entirely from the sentence. For example, instead of saying:</p>
      <p>저는 아침식사를 안 먹었어요 = I didn’t eat breakfast</p>
      <p>They would say:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-1.mp3">아침식사를 안 먹었어요</a> = I didn’t
        eat breakfast
      </p>
      <p>Both are perfect sentences and both can be used, but you should be aware that Korean people often get rid of
        the subject/topic altogether when speaking. This will be done from time to time throughout our lessons.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particle ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">들</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and using </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">몇</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> with a counter</span>
      </p>
      <p>You have probably been asking yourself ‘how can I make something plural?’ Up to now, I haven’t mentioned
        anything about plural words in Korean. The reason for this is Korean people rarely distinguish between singular
        and plural. For example, if I say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s1.mp3">나는 사과를 샀어</a></p>
      <p>This could mean “I bought an apple” OR “I bought apples.” This seems crazy to English speakers, but this is
        just how it is done in Korean. In most cases, the context can make it clear if you bought ‘an apple’ or if you
        bought ‘apples.’ If you really want to make it clear that you bought one apple, you could say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s2.mp3">나는 사과 한 개를 샀어</a> = I
        bought one apple</p>
      <p>When dealing with the ambiguity of singular/plural sentences in Korean, you could also use the word 몇 which can
        replace a number in these examples: 두 개/두 명/두 번. When 몇 replaces a number in these cases (몇 번/몇 명/몇 개), it has
        the meaning of “some ____.” For example, instead of saying: “<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s2.mp3">나는 사과 한 개를 샀어</a>”, you
        could say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-4.mp3">나는 사과 몇 개를 샀어</a> = I
        bought SOME apples</p>
      <p>More examples (remember that 펜 한 개 and 한 개의 펜 have the same meaning):<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-5.mp3">나는 몇 개의 펜을 샀어</a> = I
        bought some pens<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-6.mp3">나는 몇 명의 사람을 만났어</a> = I met
        some people<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-7.mp3">나는 학교에 몇 번 갔어</a> = I went
        to school a few/some times (not sometimes)<br />
        <em>(remember, </em>번<em> acts as an adverb &#8211; so it doesn&#8217;t need a particle to be attached to
          it).</em>
      </p>
      <p>Anyways, back to what I was trying to say earlier. ~들 can be attached to a noun to make that noun plural.
        However, adding ~들 to a noun that is not referring to a person is usually unnatural. Therefore, it would be
        unnatural to say something like this:</p>
      <p>저는 사과들을 샀어요</p>
      <p>Instead, ~들 is usually only attached to the word “person” (사람) or other words with the meaning of people (for
        example: actors, workers, doctors, etc…).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-8.mp3">의사들은 돈이 많아</a> = doctors
        have a lot of money<br />

          않아</a> = actors usually don’t like their movies<br />

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particle ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">만</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> (only)</span></p>
      <p>The particle ~만 is very common and has the meaning of “only.” It can be attached directly to the end of a noun
        to express “only (that noun).” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-11.mp3">나는 물만 마셔</a> = I only
        drink water</p>
      <p>It can be attached to the subject or the object of a sentence, and in each case it replaces the particle that
        would normally be attached there (~은/는 or ~을/를) or For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-12.mp3">나만 그 여자를 좋아해</a> = Only I
        like that girl<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-1.mp3">나는 그 여자만 좋아해</a>
        = I only like that girl
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-14.mp3">나만 사과를 샀어</a> = Only I
        bought apples<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-15.mp3">나는 사과만 샀어</a> = I only
        bought apples
      </p>
      <p>You could also stress that you only bought <strong>one</strong> apple (or any other number of things) by
        placing ~만 on a counter:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-16.mp3">나는 사과 한 개만 샀어</a> = I
        only bought 1 apple<br />

        = I only have two cars<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-4.mp3">저는 친구 한 명만
          만났어요</a> = I only met one friend
      </p>
      <p>I said it once before in <a title="Lesson 3: Korean Verbs/Adjectives"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-3/">Lesson 3</a>, but it is
        something that learners of Korean often forget: When a verb ends in 하다, the part before 하다 is usually a noun
        form of that verb. The examples I gave before were:</p>
      <p>성공하다 = succeed<br />
        성공 = success</p>
      <p>말하다 = speak<br />
        말 = speech/words</p>
      <p>성취하다 = achieve<br />
        성취 = achievement</p>
      <p>With these verbs, the part before 하다 can be separated from 하다 to make a noun form of that verb. Then, “하다,”
        meaning “do” can act on that noun (I do study = I study). It is hard to explain, but look at the following
        example:</p>
      <p>나는 공부했어 = I studied<br />
        나는 공부를 했어 = I studied</p>
      <p>Those two mean exactly the same thing, even though in the second example, 공부 is used as a stand-alone noun. But
        why is all of this important? It is important because now you can treat 공부 as a regular noun, which means you
        can attach 만 to it:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-19.mp3">저는 공부만 했어요</a> = I only
        studied<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-20.mp3">저는 어제 일만 했어요</a> =
        Yesterday, I only worked
      </p>
      <p>Note that just because a word ends in 하다, doesn’t mean you can do this. For example, many adjectives end in 하다
        (for example: 행복하다: happy), but this:</p>
      <p>저는 행복만 해요 = I am only happy – doesn’t really make a lot of sense</p>
      <p>Also, many verbs don’t end in 하다 and just end in 다 (for example: 가다, 먹다, 보내다). The way that you can change
        those verbs into a form that allows ~만 to be attached will be discussed in <a
          title="Lesson 29: Changing Nouns to Verbs with ~기 and 음/ㅁ"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-29/">Lesson
          29</a>.</p>
      <p>The examples above show ~만 attached to nouns, but really it can be attached to a wide variety of things –
        including grammatical principles and other particles, which we&#8217;ll get into after a few more lessons on
        Korean basics.</p>
      <p>When ~만 gets attached to more complicated things, it usually doesn’t replace something, but overlaps it. What I
        mean is, when ~만 is attached to the subject or object, ~을/를 or ~은/는 get eliminated. However, when ~만 is attached
        to something else, everything usually stays in place.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;ll show now how it can be attached to the ~에 particle we&#8217;ve covered, and follow up in later
        lessons with other particles.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particle ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">에서</span></p>
      <p>Foreign learners of Korean are often very confused as to when they should use ~에서 instead of ~에, as they both
        denote places in Korean sentences. ~에서 is used to denote the location in which the subject is doing something.
      </p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-26.mp3">저는 학교에서 공부할 거예요</a> = I
        will study at school<br />

        saw my friend at the hospital<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-28.mp3">저는 남편을 공원에서 만날 거예요</a> = I
        will meet my husband at the park<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-29.mp3">저는 한국어를 한국에서 배웠어요</a> = I
        learned Korean in Korea
      </p>
      <p>In order to help you understand the purpose of ~에서, I would like to make a distinction between ~에 and ~에서. As I
        said, ~에서 is used to indicate the location in which the subject is doing something.</p>
      <p>This does <em>not </em>mean the location that he/she is going to<br />
        This does <em>not </em>mean the location that he/she looking at<br />
        This does <em>not </em>mean the location that he/she places something on<br />
        This does <em>not </em>mean the location that he/she places something in</p>
      <p>All of the locations from those examples above would require the particle “~에” to denote the location.</p>
      <p>~에서, on the other hand refers to the location where the subject – the acting agent of the sentence – is in when
        actually doing the action. Let’s look at the following example:</p>
      <p>저는 건물에 간판을 봤어요</p>
      <p>In this sentence, where is the subject (저) when doing the action (보다)? ~에서 is not used in this sentence, so it
        is unknown as to where the subject was when he/she saw the sign. It might be known from context, but this
        specific sentence is not describing it. Therefore, the person is saying that he/she saw the sign “on the
        building” – as if he/she was walking by and saw the sign attached to the building in some way. The action did
        not <em>occur </em>at/on/in the building, it’s just the location in which he/she was looking at.</p>
      <p>Conversely, look at this sentence:<br />
        저는 건물에서 간판을 봤어요</p>
      <p>In this sentence, where is the subject (저) when doing this action (보다)? ~에서 is attached to “건물.” Therefore, the
        subject was <em>in </em>the building and saw the sign.</p>
      <p>Another example:</p>
      <p>저는 병을 탁자에 놓았어요</p>
      <p>In this sentence, where is the subject (저) when doing the action (놓다)? ~에서 is not used in this sentence, so it
        is unknown as to where the subject was when he/she put the bottle on the table. It might be known from context,
        but this specific sentence is not describing it. Therefore, the person is saying that he/she put the bottle “on
        the table.”</p>
      <p>Conversely, look at this sentence:<br />
        저는 병을 탁자에서 놓았어요</p>
      <p>This sentence is nonsense. It is indicating that, the action actually occurred on/in the table. That is, the
        subject somehow within the table placed the bottle somewhere. But the sentence is so nonsensical that it is not
        even indicating where the bottle is placed. It could translate to something like “(While I was) in the table, I
        placed the bottle.” Don’t get too hung up on that translation because it’s hard to translate a sentence that
        doesn’t make sense.</p>
      <p>However, because ~에서 can be used to indicate where the subject is acting, and because ~에 can be used to in this
        sentence to indicate where the bottle is placed, both ~에 and ~에서 can be used in the same sentence. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-10.mp3">저는 방에서 탁자에 병을
          놓았어요</a> = I placed the bottle on the table in the room</p>
      <p>This is the same reason that the particle ~에 is placed on the location to which a person is going. For example,
        if I said something like this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s3.mp3">저는 한국에서 갈 거예요</a><br />
        <em>(This sentence is correct, but it is stating that the person left from Korea because the action of “going”
          (</em><em>가다</em><em>) is occurring at/in Korea). This function is talked about a little bit later.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Instead, in order to indicate the place to which you are going (and, therefore, not currently in/at), you must
        use ~에. For example:</p>
      <p>저는 한국에 갈 거예요 = I will go to Korea</p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>~에서 can also be attached to a location where an adjective “occurs.” The word “occurs” is a bad way to describe
        this (because adjectives don’t really “occur”, but I can’t think of a better word. Just like how a verb can be
        used with a subject…:</p>
      <p>저는 잤어요 = I slept</p>
      <p>…and a location can be used in this sentence to indicate where that action occurred:</p>
      <p>저는 집에서 잤어요 = I slept at home</p>
      <p>In that same sense, adjectives can be used with a subject…:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-11.mp3">과일은 비싸요</a> =
        Fruit is expensive</p>
      <p>… and a location can be used in this sentence to indicate where that adjective “occurs”:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-12.mp3">과일은 한국에서
          비싸요</a> = Fruit is expensive in Korea</p>
      <p>Here are some other examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-13.mp3">저는 학교에서
          추웠어요</a> = I was cold at school<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-14.mp3">고등학교는 한국에서
          어려워요</a> = High school is difficult in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-15.mp3">녹차는 한국에서
          유명해요</a> = Green Tea is famous in Korea
      </p>
      <p>I don’t want to provide a ton of examples for this because in order to make perfectly natural sentences, it
        requires the use of other, more complicated grammar that you haven’t been introduced to yet. For now, try to
        understand this specific function of ~에서 and how it can be used to indicate where a verb or adjective “occurs.”
      </p>
      <p>Also note that when you indicate where something is by using 있다, you should use ~에 instead of ~에서. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-16.mp3">저는 집에 있어요</a> =
        I’m at home<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-17.mp3">저는 차 안에 있어요</a>
        = I’m in the car
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>The other main usage of ~에서 has the general meaning of “from.” In it’s most basic sense, it can be used to
        indicate the place from which the subject is departing. This is the usage I mentioned earlier. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s3.mp3">저는 한국에서 갈 거예요</a> = I
        will go from Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-39.mp3">다음 버스는 저 정류장에서 출발할 거예요</a>
        = The next bus will depart from that station
      </p>
      <p>This same usage can be applied to more complicated scenarios that are similar to “departing.” For example:</p>
      <p>When you are getting off of something (bus/train):<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-40.mp3">저는 서울역에서 내릴 거예요</a> = I
        will get off at (from) Seoul station
      </p>
      <p>When something/someone is coming/going/being taken out of something:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-41.mp3">학생은 교실에서 나왔어요</a> = the
        student came out of the classroom
      </p>
      <p>You can also use this to indicate the country (or any other place, for that matter) that you come from. In
        English, we say “I come from Canada/I’m from Canada” but in Korean the past tense of “come” must be used:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-18.mp3">저는 캐나다에서
          왔어요</a> = I come from Canada</p>
      <p>I don’t want to go on a rant here, but one of the things that bugs me is the textbooks that teach “저는 ___에서
        왔어요” in the first or second lesson – before any of the grammar concepts within the sentence have been taught.
        For example, when I first started learning Korean, I had a textbook that taught me “저는 ____에서 왔어요” on the very
        first page. Without explaining why I was using 저 instead of 나, why I was using 는, what 에서 meant, what 오다 meant,
        how/why 오다 changes to 왔다, how/why 왔다 changes to 왔어요. But I digress…</p>
      <p>It is also important to know that when ~에서 is added to the words 여기/거기/저기 (here, there, there), it is common to
        write/say:</p>
      <p>여기서 instead of 여기에서<br />
        거기서 instead of 거기에서<br />
        저기서 instead of 저기에서</p>
      <p>In addition to the examples provided, there are more ways in which ~에서 can be used to mean “from.” Below is a
        sneak preview of more ways ~에서 can be used to mean “from,” but I&#8217;ve used some grammar forms not yet
        introduced. Making a mental note of these types of sentences might help you when you come across similar
        sentences later.</p>
      <p>저는 학교에서 멀리 살고 있어요 = I live far from school<br />
        1에서 10까지 센다 = Count from 1 to 10<br />
        그들은 많은 후보자들 중에서 저를 뽑았어요 = They chose me from many candidates<br />
        1시에서 2시까지 오세요 = Please come from 1:00 to 2:00<br />
        10에서 5를 뺀다 = Subtract 5 from 10</p>
      <p>As you can see, ‘from’ (in English) has many usages as well. When a word has a lot of meanings in Korean – and
        the corresponding English word also has a lot of meanings &#8211; mastering the usage can be challenging, but
        also rewarding when it all comes together.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particles ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">부터</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and ~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">까지</span></p>
      <p>Two more important Korean particles you need to know are ~부터 and ~까지.</p>
      <p>~까지 can be used in sentences with or without ~에서 to have the meaning of &#8220;to/until a place/time.&#8221;
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-43.mp3">3시까지 기다릴 거예요</a> = I will
        wait until 3:00<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-44.mp3">그 여자를 지금까지 좋아했어요</a> = I
        liked that girl until now<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-45.mp3">저는 그 회사에서 5월까지 일할 거예요</a>
        = I will work at that company until May<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-19.mp3">저는 그때까지 김치를 먹지
          않았어요</a> = I hadn’t eaten Kimchi until that time<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-20.mp3">저는 오늘 이 책을 여기까지
          읽었어요</a> = Today, I read up to here in this book<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-21.mp3">저는 한강까지 달렸어요</a>
        = I ran until (I reached) the Han River
      </p>
      <p>~부터 is a particle that is often confused with ~에서 because both can translate to “from” and have seemingly
        overlapping usages. You learned earlier that one usage of ~에서 is to indicate the location from which an action
        is departing. For example:</p>
      <p>우리는 집에서 출발할 거예요 = We will depart from home</p>
      <p>~부터 is very similar, but is specifically identifying the place (or time) in which something <em>starts</em>
        from. If we look at this sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-22.mp3">나는 인천에서 서울까지 갈
          거야</a> = I will depart from Incheon and go to (until) Seoul</p>
      <p>The particle ~에서 identifies that the person departed from 인천. In theory, this could also be seen as the
        starting point. Therefore, this sentence could also be written as:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-50.mp3">나는 인천부터 서울까지 갈 거야</a> = I
        will go from Incheon to Seoul</p>
      <p>These two sentences (despite the slight nuance of “departing” and “starting”) are essentially the same. In both
        cases, the subject is going from Incheon to Seoul. They can both be seen as correct, but most Koreans would
        rather use ~에서 when talking about the location in which something starts/departs.</p>
      <p>For example, I showed these two sentences to a Korean person and asked him to explain the difference:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-39.mp3">다음 버스는 저 정류장에서 출발할
          거예요</a><br />
        = The next bus will depart from that station</p>
      <p>다음 버스는 저 정류장부터 출발할 거예요<br />
        = The next bus will leave from that stop</p>
      <p>He said: “The first one sounds more natural. The second one sounds as if the place the bus is leaving from is
        the bus garage… like the absolute starting point of the bus. In most situations, it would be most natural to say
        the first sentence.”</p>
      <p>Instead, ~부터 is commonly attached to a <em>time </em>to indicate <em>when </em>something starts. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-23.mp3">저는 어제부터
          아팠어요</a> = I have been sick since (from) yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-24.mp3">저는 내일부터 한국어를 공부할
          거예요</a> = I’m going to study Korean from tomorrow<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-25.mp3">내년부터 우리는 서울에서 살
          거예요</a> = From next year, we will be living in Seoul<sup><br />
        </sup><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-26.mp3">저는 3시부터
          학교에 있을 거예요</a> = I will be at school from 3:00<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-27.mp3">저는 작년부터 한국어를
          배웠어요</a> = I have been learning Korean since last year
      </p>
      <p>It is very common to see ~까지 used in the same sentence as ~부터. Here, ~부터 indicates the starting point and ~까지
        indicates the end point. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-57.mp3">저는 아침부터 밤까지 공부만 했어요</a> =
        From morning to night I only studied<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-58.mp3">나는 캐나다에 1일부터 8일까지 있을
          거야</a> = I will be in Canada from the 1<sup>st</sup> to the 8<sup>th</sup>
      </p>
      <p>It is common to see “부터” attached to 처음 to translate to something like “from the start” or “from the
        beginning.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-28.mp3">그들은 저를 처음부터
          싫어했어요</a> = They didn’t like me from the start<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-29.mp3">우리는 그 일을 처음부터
          시작할 거예요</a> = We will start that job/task from the beginning

      <p>When used to say “from start to finish,” the word “끝” is often used to mean “finish.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-30.mp3">저는 그 상황을 처음부터
          끝까지 몰랐어요</a> = I didn’t know that situation from start to finish<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-31.mp3">저는 그것을 처음부터 끝까지
          복습했어요</a> = I reviewed that from start to finish<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-32.mp3">저는 그 책을 처음부터 끝까지
          읽었어요</a> = I read that book from start to finish
      </p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particle ~(</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">으</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">로</span></p>
      <p>The Korean particle ~(으)로 can be added to nouns with a few different meanings. One of the main meanings is to
        indicate with what tool/device/method/material something is carried out. The English equivalent varies depending
        on the usage:</p>
      <p>Write <strong>with</strong> a pen<br />
        Go to the store <strong>by</strong> car<br />
        Go to school <strong>on </strong>foot<br />
        Make a house <strong>out of </strong>wood</p>
      <p>This meaning of ~(으)로 can be used in so many situations it would be impossible to list them all. As you get
        comfortable with the basic examples of this usage, you will slowly be able to grasp when it should be used in
        all situations.</p>
      <p>~로 is added to words ending in a vowel, whereas ~으로 is added to words ending in a consonant. ~로 is also added
        to words ending in ㄹ. The only reason for this difference is for ease of pronunciation. If you say “것로” there is
        a split second where your tongue cannot go directly from 것 to ~로 – so it is changed to 것<strong>으</strong>로.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-64.mp3">나는 우리 집을 나무로 지었어</a> = I
        built our house out of wood<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-65.mp3">배로 제주에 갈 거야</a> = I will
        go to Je-ju by boat<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-66.mp3">저는 그것을 손으로 만들었어요</a> = I
        built that with my hands
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In this same respect, ~(으)로 can be used to indicate the language which something is spoken. Here, just like in
        some of the examples above, the language acts as the “tool” in which something was communicated. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-33.mp3">저는 그 문장을 한국어로
          말했어요</a> = I said that sentence (using) in Korean<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-34.mp3">저는 그것을 영어로 할
          거예요</a> = I will say that (using) in English
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>It is also used to indicate what you ate for a specific meal:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-69.mp3">저는 아침식사로 밥을 먹었어요</a> = I
        ate rice for breakfast<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-70.mp3">저는 보통 점심식사로 과일만 먹었어요</a> =
        I usually only ate fruit for lunch
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>If somebody does an action in line with a bunch of other people, you can use ~(으)로 to indicate the order
        something is done by attaching it to a number + 번째. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-35.mp3">저는 그것을 두 번째로
          했어요</a> = I did that second (I was the second person to do that)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-36.mp3">저는 학교에 두 번째로
          왔어요</a> = I came to school second (I was the second person to come to school)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-37.mp3">저는 그것을 첫 번째로 할
          거예요</a> = I will go (do it) first
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The other main meaning of ~(으)로 is to indicate the direction that something is happening in. This sometimes has
        the same meaning as &#8220;에.&#8221;For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-74.mp3">저는 집으로 갈 거예요</a> = I will
        go in the direction of home (simply ‘I will go home’), which would be the same as:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-12-s4.mp3">저는 집에 갈 거예요</a> = I will
        go home
      </p>
      <p>~(으)로 is often added after ~쪽 to make “~쪽으로”. ~쪽 can be added after some nouns and some direction words
        (above/below/East/West/etc) to mean “the direction of ___.”</p>
      <p>그쪽 = that way/direction<br />
        위쪽 = upper direction<br />
        사람 쪽 = the direction of the people, etc..</p>
      <p>To make sentences like:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-76.mp3">저의 친구는 저 쪽으로 갔어요</a> = My
        friend went that way<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson12-77.mp3">학생들은 교실 쪽으로 걸어요</a> =
        Students walk towards/in the direction of their class
      </p>
      <p>Notice the difference between these two:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-38.mp3">저는 집 안 쪽으로
          달렸어요</a> = I ran inside the house<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson-12-sentence-39.mp3">저는 집 안에서
          달렸어요</a> = I ran inside the house
      </p>
      <p>In the first example, you are running into the house/in the direction of ‘inside the house.’ In the second
        example, you are running inside the house.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swm1JYafsE">Here is a Korean sign that is used to warn passengers
          that the door opens &#8220;in the direction of inside&#8221; by saying &#8220;안쪽으로&#8221;! Watch me analyze
          the grammar and the vocabulary found on this sign.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcbM1Vgvu9I">Here is a Korean sign that is used to indicate that you
          should not go &#8220;in the direction&#8221; of below/downwards by saying &#8220;아래로.&#8221; Watch me analyze
          the grammar and the vocabulary found on this sign.</a></p>
      <p>That’s it for this lesson! I wanted to cover a few more particles, but this lesson already has way too much in
        it! In the next lesson, I will introduce you to more of these common particles. Until then, make sure you review
        this lesson before you move on!</p>
