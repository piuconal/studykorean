      <div id="target-id678353ce3e739" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: Certain types of words can be placed before nouns to describe them. For example, adjectives can be
          placed before nouns to describe them (for example: a <u>pretty</u> girl). 이 is a type of word called a “관형사,”
          which isn’t an adjective, but is another type of word that can be placed before nouns to describe them. In
          English, “관형사” translates to a “modifier” or “a determiner.” 이 is placed before nouns within reaching distance
          to indicate that one is talking about “this” specific thing. For example:</p>
        <p>이 사람 = this person</p>
        <p>Other examples of determiners in Korean (and English) are:</p>
        <p>그 사람 = <u>that</u> person<br />
          모든 사람 = <u>all</u> people<br />
          어떤 사람 = <u>which</u> person</p>
        <p>It is easy to distinguish between a determiner and an adjective in Korean. Although both placed before nouns
          to
          “describe” them, the dictionary (ordinary) form of an adjective always ends in ~다 and must change in order to
          describe them. For example, 예쁘다 changes to 예쁜 when placed before a noun to describe it (See Lesson 3 for more
          information). Determiners keep their original form when placed before a noun. This might be too much grammar
          for
          you at this point, but make a note of it.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          <strong>이</strong> 차는 너무 비싸요 = <strong>This</strong> car is too expensive<br />
          <strong>이</strong> 방은 넓습니다 = <strong>This</strong> room is big/wide<br />
          저는 <strong>이</strong> 영화를 더 이상 보고 싶지 않아요 = I don’t want to watch <strong>this</strong> movie anymore<br />
          <strong>이</strong> 고기는 돼지고기입니다 = <strong>This</strong> meat is pork<br />
          <strong>이</strong> 사람은 저의 누나예요 = <strong>This</strong> (person) is my sister
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/wLesson-1-8.mp3">그</a> = <span

      <div id="target-id678353ce3e750" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: 그 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 그 is placed before nouns that are being referred to from
          context or a previous sentence. For example, if your father is talking about a specific person, you can refer
          to
          “that person” by saying “그 사람.”</p>
        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          그것 = that thing<br />
          그 사람 = that person</p>
        <p>See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          <strong>그</strong> 남자는 저의 아버지예요 = <strong>That</strong> man is my father<br />
          <strong>그</strong> 여자는 나랑 결혼하고 싶었어요 = <strong>That</strong> girl wanted to marry me<br />
          저는 <strong>그</strong> 책을 원해요 = I want <strong>that</strong> book<br />
          <strong>그</strong> 병원은 멉니다 = <strong>That</strong> hospital is far<br />

      <div id="target-id678353ce3e768" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: 저 is another example of a “관형사” in Korean. 저 is placed before nouns that are far away (not within
          reach). For example, if you want to refer to the person across the street, you can refer to “that person” by
          saying “저 사람.”</p>
        <p>그 and 저 both translate to “that.” This often causes confusion for English speakers.</p>
        <p>Also notice that “저” has more than one meaning. Earlier, you saw that “저” means “I/me.” Welcome to the world
          of
          Korean! Where often times one word has more than one meaning.</p>
        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          저것 = that thing<br />
          저 사람 = that person</p>
        <p>See more information about 관형사 in my description of “이” above.</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          <strong>저</strong> 사람은 누구예요? = Who is <strong>that</strong> person?<br />
          저는 <strong>저</strong> 케이크를 먹고 싶어요 = I want to eat <strong>that</strong> cake<br />
          <strong>저</strong> 바지가 얼마예요? = How much are <strong>those</strong> pants?<br />
          저의 친구는 <strong>저</strong> 쪽으로 갔어요 = My friend went <strong>that</strong> way<br />
          <strong>저</strong> 학교는 역사적인 건물이에요 = <strong>That</strong> school is a historical building<br />

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Greeting Words</span></p>
      <p>Throughout my lessons, I will only use grammar and vocabulary that you have learned from a previous lesson. In
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit0/">Unit 0</a>, I taught you how to write words in Korean. Above,
        you
        can see the first set of words you should study to get you started. I have not yet taught you how to
        <em>use</em>
        those words or how conjugate them.
      </p>
      <p>The words for “hello,” “thank you,” “how are you,” and “please” are actually quite difficult in Korean. There
        is
        actually grammar within the words themselves. At this stage, I would simply memorize these “greeting words” as
        one
        unit, and you can worry about the grammar within them later when it becomes relevant. The words are:</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Hello.mp3">안녕하세요</a> = hello</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">감사하다 and 고맙다 are the two words that are commonly used to say &#8220;thank you.&#8221;
        However, they are rarely used in those forms and are almost always conjugated. They can be conjugated in a
        variety
        of ways, which will be introduced in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lesson 5</a> and <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>. The most
        common
        ways to conjugate these words are:</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new1.mp3">감사합니다</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new2.mp3">감사해요</a>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new3.mp3">고마워</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new4.mp3">고맙습니다</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new5.mp3">고마워요</a>
      </p>
      <p>The way to say “how are you?” in Korean is:</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new6.mp3">잘 지내세요?</a> = How are you?
      </p>
      <p>Although this is the most literal way to ask “how are you?” in Korean, it is not as common as the English
        expression. Korean people love food, and common way to greet somebody is to ask them if they have eaten. The
        idea
        of asking questions in Korean is taught in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">Lesson
          21</a>.</p>
      <p>The way to say “please” in Korean is:</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Lesson-1new7.mp3">제발</a> = Please</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">It is, of course, important for you to memorize these expressions in Korean, but you
        need to know that there is a reason why they are said that way. For now, don’t worry about <em>why</em> they are
        said that way, and simply memorize them. We will get back to them in later lessons when they become important.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sentence Word Order<strong><br />
          </strong></span></p>
      <p>Korean has a sentence structure that is hard to grasp initially for English speakers. For our purposes in
        Lesson
        1, the words in Korean sentences are written in the following order:</p>
      <p>Subject – Object – Verb (for example: I hamburger eat)<br />
        Or<br />
        Subject – Adjective (for example: I beautiful)</p>
      <p>I am going to quickly explain what a “subject” and “object” mean, as your ability to understand later concepts
        depends on your understanding of this.<br />
        The subject refers to person/thing/noun/whatever that is acting. The subject does the action of the verb. For
        example, the subject in each sentence below is underlined:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> went to the park<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> will go to the park<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My mom</span> loves me<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He</span> loves me<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The dog</span> ran fast<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The clouds</span> cleared up
      </p>
      <p>In English, the subject always comes before the verb.</p>
      <p>The object refers to whatever the verb is acting <i>on</i>. For example, the object in each sentence below is
        underlined</p>
      <p>My mom loves <span style="text-decoration: underline;">me<br />
        </span>The dog bit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the mailman</span><br />
        He ate <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rice<br />
        </span>Students studied <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean</span></p>
      <p>In English, the object always comes after the verb. However, a sentence with a verb does not require an object.
        For example:</p>
      <p>I slept<br />
        I ate<br />
        He died</p>
      <p>Sometimes there is no object because it has simply been omitted from the sentence. For example, “I ate” or “I
        ate
        rice” are both correct sentences. Other verbs, by their nature, cannot act on an object. For example, you cannot
        place an object after the verbs “to sleep” or “to go:”</p>
      <p>I sleep you<br />
        I go you</p>
      <p>Subjects are also present in sentences with adjectives. However, there is no object in a sentence with an
        adjective. The subjects are underlined in the following adjective-sentences below:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">School</span> is boring<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> am boring<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The movie</span> was funny<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The building</span> is big<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">My girlfriend</span> is pretty<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The food</span> is delicious
      </p>
      <p>Verbs and adjectives are placed at the <em>end</em> of a sentence. Actually, every Korean sentence and clause
        must end in one of the following:</p>
      <p>&#8211; A verb<br />
        &#8211; An adjective, or<br />
        &#8211; 이다</p>
      <p>I talk about the meaning of 이다 later in this lesson. It is neither a verb nor an adjective, but it behaves like
        them. Every verb, every adjective and 이다 end in “다,” and these are the only words in Korean that can be
        conjugated.</p>
      <p>Korean also has a formality system built into the language. That is, the way one speaks to an older person who
        deserves high respect would be different than the way one speaks to a friend. There are many ways words in a
        sentence can change depending on the formality of the situation, but the two most common, basic and important
        things to be aware of are:</p>
      <p>1) There are two ways to say “I” or “me” in Korean:</p>
      <p>나, used in informal situations, and<br />
        저, used in formal situations.</p>
      <p>2) There are many ways to conjugate a word. As we saw above, the word 고맙다 can be conjugated many different
        ways.
        It is important to know which conjugation to use in which situation. This is taught in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>. Until Lesson
        6,
        I make no distinction of formality and the focus is more on sentence structure than conjugations. Until then,
        you
        will see both 나 and 저 arbitrarily used. Don&#8217;t worry about why one is used over the other until Lesson 6,
        when formalities will be explained.</p>
      <p>Okay, now that you know all of that, we can talk about making Korean sentences.</p>
      <h3><a name="kp"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Particles (~는/은 and ~를/을)<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>Most words in a Korean sentence have a particle (a fancy word to say ‘something’) attached to them. These
        particles indicate the role of each word in a sentence &#8211; that is, specifically <em>which </em>word is the
        subject or object. Note that there is absolutely no way of translating these particles to English, as we do not
        use anything like them.<br />
        The following are the particles you should know for this lesson:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">는 or 은</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
          (Subject)<br />
        </span>This is placed after a word to indicate that it is the subject of a sentence.<br />
        Use 는 when the last letter of the last syllable of the subject is a vowel. For example:<br />
        나 = 나는<br />
        저 = 저는</p>
      <p>Use 은 when the last letter of the last syllable of the subject is a consonant. For example:<br />
        집 = 집은<br />
        책 = 책은</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">를 or 을 (Object)<br />
        </span>This is placed after a word to indicate that is the object of a sentence.<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
        </span>Use 를 when the last letter of the last syllable is a vowel. For example:<br />
        나 = 나를<br />
        저 = 저를</p>
      <p>Use을 when the last letter of the last syllable is a consonant. For example:<br />
        집 = 집을<br />
        책 = 책을</p>
      <p>We can now make sentences using the Korean sentence structure and the Korean particles.</p>
      <p>1) I speak Korean = I는 Korean을 speak<br />
        는 is attached to &#8220;I&#8221; (the subject)<br />
        을 is attached to &#8220;Korean&#8221; (the object)</p>
      <p>2) I like you = I는 you를 like<br />
        는 is attached to &#8220;I&#8221; (the subject)<br />
        를 is attached to &#8220;you&#8221; (the object)</p>
      <p>3) I wrote a letter = I는 letter을 wrote<br />
        는 is attached to &#8220;I&#8221; (the subject)<br />
        을 is attached to &#8220;letter&#8221; (the object)</p>
      <p>4) I opened the door = I는 door을 opened<br />
        는 is attached to “I” (the subject)<br />
        을 is attached to “the door” (the object)</p>
      <p>5) My mom will make pasta = My mom은 pasta를 will make<br />
        은 is attached to “my mom” (the subject)<br />
        를 is attached to “pasta” (the object)</p>
      <p>The same could be done for sentences with adjectives. However, remember that sentences with adjectives will not
        have an object:</p>
      <p>1) My girlfriend is pretty: My girlfriend은 is pretty<br />
        &#8220;은&#8221; is attached to &#8220;my girlfriend&#8221; (the subject)</p>
      <p>2) The movie was scary = The movie는 was scary<br />
        &#8220;는&#8221; is attached to &#8220;the movie&#8221; (the subject)</p>
      <p>We will now switch our focus to using actual Korean words to create sentences ending in 이다.</p>
      <h3><a name="tobe"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be: 이다</span></p>
      <p>Let’s start building sentences in Korean. In this lesson, we will start by making simple sentences using the
        word
        이다. The translation for “이다” is “to be.” English speakers often don’t realize how difficult the word “to be” is.
        Depending on who is being referred to, the word “to be” could be any of the underlined words below:</p>
      <p>I <u>am</u> a man<br />
        He <u>is</u> a man<br />
        They <u>are</u> men<br />
        I <u>was</u> a man<br />
        They <u>were</u> men</p>
      <p>In each of those sentences, a different word (is, am, are, was, were) is used depending on the subject and
        tense
        of the sentence. I can’t imagine how difficult this would be for an English learner. In Korean, the 이다 is used
        to
        represent all of those “to be” words.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, 이다 can be conjugated. In that way, 이다 is similar to verbs and adjectives, but the rules
        for
        이다 are often (but not always) different. I will teach you how 이다 differs from verbs and adjectives as it becomes
        important in later lessons. For example, in Lesson 52 you will learn that the process for quoting a sentence
        with
        이다 is different than with verbs and adjectives.</p>
      <p>Like adjectives, 이다 can not act on an object. Only verbs can act on objects. For example:</p>
      <p>I eat hamburgers (eat is a verb, the object is a hamburger)<br />
        She meets my friend (meet is a verb, the object is my friend)<br />
        They study Korean (study is a verb, the object is Korean)<br />
        We listen to music (listen is a verb, the object is music)</p>
      <p>All of those sentences (can) have objects because the verb is the predicate of the sentence. However, in
        sentences that are predicated by adjectives, there will not be an object</p>
      <p>I am pretty<br />
        She is beautiful<br />
        They are hungry<br />
        We are smart</p>
      <p>Look at those four sentences. When we use adjectives in English, we must also use “to be” words like am, is and
        are. In other words, we cannot make sentences like this:</p>
      <p>I pretty<br />
        She beautiful<br />
        They hungry<br />
        We smart</p>
      <p>Unlike in English, 이다 is <em>not </em>used in these types of sentences. That is, we do not use 이다 to indicate
        that something “is” an adjective. The structure of sentences predicated by adjectives is discussed in Lesson 3.
      </p>
      <p>So, 이다 is not used in these types of sentences:</p>
      <p>I <u>am</u> pretty<br />
        She <u>is</u> beautiful<br />
        They <u>are</u> hungry<br />
        We <u>are</u> smart</p>
      <p>However, 이다 <em>is </em>used in these types of sentences:</p>
      <p>I <u>am</u> a man<br />
        He <u>is</u> a man<br />
        They <u>are</u> men<br />
        I <u>was</u> a man<br />
        They <u>were</u> men</p>
      <p>이다 is used to indicate that a noun <em>is </em>a noun. The basic structure for a sentence predicated by “이다”
        is:
      </p>
      [noun은/는] [another noun][이다]
      <p>For example:<br />
        I는 man이다 = I am a man</p>
      <p>Now substitute the words for “man” and “I,” which are:</p>
      <p>나 = I<br />
        남자 = man</p>
      <p>The Korean sentence would look like this:</p>
      <p>나는 남자이다 = I am a man</p>
      <p>Notice that 이다 is attached directly to the second noun. Verbs and adjectives are not attached to nouns like
        this,
        but 이다 is. It would be incorrect to include a space between the second noun and 이다. For example, this would be
        incorrect:</p>
      <p>나는 남자 이다</p>
      <p>Although it might look and feel like “남자” is an object in that sentence, it is not. 이다, like adjectives and
        unlike verbs cannot act on an object. It would be incorrect to include the object particle on the second noun.
        For
        example, this would be incorrect:</p>
      <p>나는 남자를 이다</p>
      <hr />
      <p>The focus of this lesson (and <a title="Lesson 2: Korean Particles 이/가"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-2/">Lessons 2</a>, <a

        to
        simple Korean se<em>ntence structure</em>. Until you reach <a
          title="Lesson 5: Korean Conjugation: Past, Present, Future"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lessons 5</a> and <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a> you will not be
        exposed to the conjugations and honorifics of Korean verbs, adjectives and 이다. These words are very rarely used
        without conjugations and honorifics.</p>
      <p>The conjugation of sentences is very important, but so is the structure of sentences. When creating these
        lessons, I went back in forth many times thinking about which one I should present first. You can’t conjugate
        sentences if you don’t have a logical sentence to conjugate; and you can’t create a logical sentence if you
        don’t
        know how to conjugate it. In the end, I figured it would make more sense to present the information this way –
        where learners are introduced to sentence structure and then learn how to conjugate the words within the
        sentence.
      </p>
      <p>Throughout all of my lessons, I use example sentences to show how grammar can be used. The example sentences in
        Lessons 1 – 4 are not conjugated. However, directly beneath each non-conjugated sentence is a conjugated version
        of the same sentence in parenthesis (one formal and one informal conjugation). You might want to glimpse at how
        the words are conjugated, but remember that this will be taught in<span style="color: #000000;"> <a

      <p>Other examples of 이다 in use:</p>
      <p>나는 여자이다 = I am a woman<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-1-2.mp3">나는 여자야 / 저는 여자예요</a>)</p>

      </p>
      <p>나는 ______이다 = I am a _______<br />
        (나는 _______ 이야 / 저는 _____이에요)</p>
      <p>You can substitute any noun into the blank space to make these sentences.</p>
      <p>The words &#8220;this&#8221; and &#8220;that&#8221; are often used as the subject of these types of sentences.
        Let&#8217;s now look at how we can apply 이것, 그것 and 저것 to sentences with 이다.</p>
      <h3><a name="thisthat"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This and That (이/그/저)</span></p>
      <p>You can see in the vocabulary above that the word for “this” is 이 in Korean.<br />
        We use 이 in Korean when we are talking about something that is within touching distance (For example: this pen
        &#8211; i.e. the one I am holding). Just like in English &#8220;이&#8221; (this) is placed before the noun it is
        describing. For example:</p>
      <p>이 사람 = This person<br />
        이 남자 = This man<br />
        이 여자 = This woman<br />
        이 차 = This car<br />
        이 탁자 = This table<br />
        이 의자 = This chair</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are two words for “that”: 그 and 저. Early learners of Korean are always confused with the
        difference between “그” and “저.”</p>
      <p>We use 그 when we are talking about something from a previous sentence or from previous context, regardless of
        if
        you could see it or not. Providing examples would be too difficult right now because you do not know any Korean
        sentences. However, if I were to say: “I don’t like that man [when your friend mentioned him in a previous
        sentence].” The word “that” in that sentence would be how “그” is used.</p>
      <p>We use 저 when we are talking about something that we can see, but cannot touch because it is too far away.</p>
      <p>We can place “그” or “저” before a noun to describe “this” or “that” thing just like we did with “이.”</p>
      <p>이 사람 = This person<br />
        그 사람 = That person<br />
        저 사람 = That person</p>
      <p>이 남자 = This man<br />
        그 남자 = That man<br />
        저 남자 = That man</p>
      <p>이 여자 = This woman<br />
        그 여자 = That woman<br />
        저 여자 = That woman</p>
      <p>이 의자 = This chair<br />
        그 의자 = That chair<br />
        저 의자 = That chair</p>
      <p>이 탁자 = This table<br />
        그 탁자 = That table<br />
        저 탁자 = That table</p>
      <p><em>Again, although the English translations of “</em>그<em>” and “</em>저<em>” are the same, it is important to
          remember that they are not the same word in Korean.</em></p>
      <p>One of the most common words in Korean is “것” meaning “thing.” When 이, 그 or 저 are placed before “것,” the result
        is a compound word. Therefore, when placing “것” after 이, 그 or 저, there should not be a space between the two. In
        other words, the following are words in and within themselves, and not two separate words:</p>
      <p>이것 = this thing<br />
        그것 = that thing<br />
        저것 = that thing</p>
      <p><em>We see this same phenomenon happen with other common words that you learn in future lessons. You don’t need
          to worry about this now, but we see this same thing happen with the word </em>곳<em> (meaning “place”) and
        </em>때<em> (meaning “time”).</em></p>
      <p>With these words, the word “thing” isn’t necessary in the English translation. Let me explain.</p>
      <p><em>I’ll use “that” as an example, but the same idea can be applied to the word “this.”</em></p>
      <p>“That” can be placed before a noun to describe it. As we saw earlier:</p>
      <p>That person<br />
        That man<br />
        That woman</p>
      <p>However, it can also <em>be</em> a noun itself. For example:</p>
      <p>I like that</p>
      <p>In this type of English sentence, “that” is referring to some thing that you like. It <em>is </em>a noun. It
        <em>is </em>a thing.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, the sentence could just as easily be said as:</p>
      <p>I like that <em>thing</em></p>
      <p>I don’t like to use grammatical jargon in my lessons, but if you know what these words mean, it could be
        helpful.
        In both English and Korean, “that” can be a determiner (as in, “I like that man”), and it can also be a pronoun
        (as in “I like that”). When used as a determiner in Korean, you should place 그 before a noun. When used as a
        pronoun in Korean, the word 그것 is used.</p>
      <p>In this same respect, while “이, 그 and 저” translate to “this, that and that” respectively, and are placed before
        nouns to indicate “this noun, that noun and that noun,” “이것, 그것 and 저것” <em>are</em> nouns (they are pronouns).
        Therefore, they do not need to be followed by the redundant word “thing,” although their meanings would be
        exactly
        the same:</p>
      <p>I like this<br />
        I like this thing</p>
      <p>I like that<br />
        I like that thing</p>
      <p>We can now use these nouns as subjects or objects in a sentence. We will look at how they can be used with “이다”
        next.</p>
      <h3><a name="thisthatbe"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using This/That with 이다</span></p>
      <p>Remember, 이다 translates to &#8220;to be&#8221; and is conjugated as &#8220;am/is/are&#8221; in English. Now
        that
        we know how to use 이, 그 and 저 (and 이것, 그것 and 저것), we can now make sentences like this:</p>
      <p>That person is a doctor</p>
      <p>We can start by putting those words into the Korean structure:</p>
      <p>That person는 doctor is</p>
      <p>And then changing the English words to the appropriate Korean words:</p>
      <p>그 사람은 + 의사 + 이다<br />
        그 사람은 의사이다<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/122.mp3">(그 사람은 의사야 / 그 사람은 의사예요)</a>
      </p>

        그 사람은 선생님이다 = That person is a teacher<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-1-5.mp3">그 사람은 선생님이야 / 그 사람은

      <p>그 사람은 여자이다 = That person is a woman<br />
        (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-1-9.mp3">그 사람은 여자야 / 그 사람은
          여자예요</a>)
      </p>
      <p>그것은 차이다 = That (thing) is a car<br />

      <p>Wow! That was an extremely difficult lesson. If you were to pick up another Korean text book, I am sure the
        first
        chapter would be much easier than this. Trust me though; learning this at the start will be very useful to you
        later on. When I was learning how to speak Korean, it took me months to realize some of these things (not
        because
        they were hard, but because I was using a text book that never taught me the reason why things are the way they
        are in Korean).</p>
      <p>Before you move on, make sure you understand the simple Korean sentence structure presented in this first
        lesson.
        Also, remember that the sentences not in parentheses are technically incorrect (or very very uncommon) because
        they have not been conjugated.</p>
