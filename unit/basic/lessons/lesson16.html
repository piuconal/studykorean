          style="text-decoration: underline;">적이다</span></p>
      <p>~적 is a common suffix that can be added after some nouns of Chinese origin (적 (的) is of Chinese origin). At
        first, there is no way to anticipate or expect which nouns this can be added to. As you progress through your
        Korean studies, you can sort of start anticipating this, but still, the only real way of knowing if ~적 can be
        added to a particular noun is if you have specifically learned that it can. The goal of this lesson isn’t to
        teach you all of the words that ~적 can be attached to (that would take forever). Rather, the goal of this lesson
        is to show you how you can recognize and use these words when you come across them.</p>
      <p>Adding ~적 to a noun changes it into a descriptive word that has the meaning of “relating to, or having the
        properties of’ the original noun. For example:</p>
      <p>문화 = culture<br />
        문화적 = relating to, or having the properties of culture</p>
      <p>경제 = economy<br />
        경제적 = relating to, or having the properties of economy</p>
      <p>역사 = history<br />
        역사적 = relating to, or having the properties of history</p>
      <p>However, the translations above are nonsense and a more accurate way to translate words with ~적 is to add “-al”
        to the English word. For example:</p>
      <p>문화 = culture<br />
        문화적 = cultural</p>
      <p>경제 = economy<br />
        경제적 = economical</p>
      <p>역사 = history<br />
        역사적 = historical</p>
      <p>Adding “-al” doesn’t always work with the English word, though. For example:</p>
      <p>과학 = science<br />
        과학적 = relating to, or having the properties of science<br />
        과학적 = scientific</p>
      <p>충동 = impulse/shock<br />
        충동적 = relating to, or having the properties of impulse<br />
        충동적 = impulsive</p>
      <p>The main point of this lesson is to teach you how you can understand the meaning of a word ending in ~적 even if
        you have never seen it before. This still happens to me fairly regularly – I will read something, and come
        across a word I have never seen before ending in ~적.</p>
      <p>For example, if you knew that the word “민주” meant “democracy” What do you think “민주적” would mean? A descriptive
        word that has the properties of democracy – that would be “democratic.”</p>
      <p>민주 = democracy<br />
        민주적 = democratic</p>
      <p>Though these descriptive words can be used in sentences, it is easy for a beginner to understand them when they
        are used by adding ~이다 or ~으로.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adding </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">으로</span></p>
      <p>Adding ‘으로’ to the end of ~적 changes the word into an adverb. These adverbs usually have the ending ‘ly’ in
        English. Below are the most common examples of using ~적으로 with example sentences for each:</p>
      <p>문화 = culture<br />
        문화적 = cultural<br />
        문화적으로 = culturally</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-1.mp3">한국은 지난 50년 동안 문화적으로 많이
          변했어요</a> = Korea has changed a lot culturally in the period of/during/for the past 50 years</p>
      <hr />
      <p>경제 = economy<br />
        경제적 = economical<br />
        경제적으로 = economically</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-2.mp3">그것은 경제적으로 가능하지 않아요</a> =
        That isn’t economically possible</p>
      <hr />
      <p>역사 = history<br />
        역사적 = historical<br />
        역사적으로 = historically</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-3.mp3">한국과 미국은 역사적으로 좋은 관계가
          있다</a> = Historically, Korea and the US have had a good relationship</p>

      <p>Adding ‘이다’ to the end of ~적 turns the word into an adjective that can predicate a sentence or describe an

      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A question that always comes up here is – What is the difference between using ~적이다 and just using ~적? For
        example, what is the difference between these two:</p>
      <p>경제적 = economical<br />
        경제적이다 = economical</p>
      <p>The difference between these is that ~적 is a noun, whereas ~적이다 is an adjective. Sometimes however, nouns can
        technically be used to sound like adjectives. For example:</p>
      <p>That is a big bag</p>
      <p>‘Big’ describes the type of bag it is. Big is clearly an adjective which is telling us about the type of bag
        that it is (that it is big). “Book” is clearly a noun.</p>
      <p>However, in the following example:</p>
      <p>That is a book bag</p>
      <p>In this example, ‘book’ acts as a descriptive word because it describes the type of bag it is (that it is a
        book bag).</p>
      <p>This is usually the only time that ~적 (with nothing following it) is used in Korean. That is, when it is
        actually a noun, but acting as a descriptive word within a sentence. Because it is usually used as this type of
        descriptive word, you don’t really need to worry much about the difference between ~적 and ~적이다. Just be aware
        that ~적이다 is more commonly used, and <em>how </em>they are used within a sentence. That is, when using “~적이다,”
        이다 should be conjugated, and when using “~적” nothing needs to be conjugated because it is a noun. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-12.mp3">미국은 민주적인 나라예요</a> = The
        US is a democratic nation<br />

        There is not a democratic government in North Korea
      </p>
      <p>At this point, I don’t want you to spend too much time dwelling over when you need to use ~적 vs. 적이다 . The
        purpose of this lesson was to introduce you to what ~적(이다/으로) can do to a word and how it can be used. I’ve
        created four more examples of ~적 vs. ~적이다 that I would like to show you, but please don’t worry about these too
        much. If anything, just try to understand the use of ~적(이다) in these sentences:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-10.mp3">경제적 문제가 있다</a> = There

        = I quit the company due to personal reasons (problems)<br />
        (그만두다 = to quit a job or school)

        This building is a historical building
      </p>
      <p>In all cases above, I would rather use the ~적인 form to describe the upcoming noun. The native Korean speaker
        beside me says the same thing. However, she also says that the first example of each (the examples just using ~적
        instead of ~적인) are also acceptable. In my opinion, the use of ~적인 instead of ~적 is more common in speaking and
        in printed sources. However, you are more likely to see ~적 in print sources compared to hearing it in spoken
        Korean. (i.e. ~적이다 is more common than ~적 in all cases. However, when compared only to itself, you are more
        likely to find ~적 in print than in speech).</p>
      <p>Okay, enough of that for now. Let’s talk about something else.</p>
      <h3><a name="s2"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">스럽다</span></p>
      <p>~스럽다 can also be added to some nouns to change them into an adjective, much like the function of ~적(이다). When
        doing this, ~스럽다 changes the noun into an adjective that has the “properties” of that noun. The two easiest
        examples to explain this change are:</p>
      <p>사랑 = love<br />
        사랑스럽다 = “with the properties of love”</p>
      <p>자연 = nature<br />
        자연스럽다 = “with the properties of nature”</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-16.mp3">그 여자가 아주 사랑스러워요</a> =
        That girl is something “with the properties of love”<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-22.mp3">그 여자의 머리 색깔은 자연스러워</a> =
        That girl’s hair color has “the properties of nature”
      </p>
      <p>Of course, those translations are nonsense. A more accurate translation of these words would be:</p>
      <p>사랑스럽다 = lovely<br />
        자연스럽다 = natural</p>
      <p>The only way of knowing if ~스럽다 or ~적 can be added to a word is if you have specifically learned that it can.
        Because one can never know which words ~스럽다 and ~적 can be added to, these words will always be presented as a
        separate entry in our vocabulary lists.</p>
      <p>Anyways, ~스럽다 can be added to nouns to make that noun a descriptive word:</p>
      <p>The two examples above are fairly straight-forward. However ~스럽다 is sometimes added to words that seem to
        already have an adjective form. For example:</p>
      <p>실망 = disappointment<br />
        실망하다 = to be disappointed<br />
        실망스럽다 = “with the properties of disappointment” (disappointing)</p>
      <p>I’ll do the best I can to distinguish between 실망스럽다 and 실망하다 for you.</p>
      <p>실망하다 is used to describe a person’s emotions. This could be referring to anybody’s emotions; not necessarily
        just the speaker’s emotions. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-17.mp3">저는 실망했어요</a> = I was
        disappointed<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-18.mp3">우리 아버지는 어제 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed yesterday
      </p>
      <p>If you want to say that somebody is disappointed <em>in </em>a person using 실망하다, you must attach the particle
        ~에게/한테 to the person he/she is disappointed in. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-19.mp3">저는 친구에게 실망했어요 </a>= I
        was disappointed in my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-20.mp3">우리 아버지는 저에게 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed in me
      </p>
      <p>If you want to say that somebody is disappointed in a non-person using 실망하다, you must attach the particle ~에 to
        the thing he/she is disappointed in. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-21.mp3">저는 영화에 실망했어요</a> = I was
        disappointed in the movie<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-22.mp3">우리 아버지는 식당에 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed in the restaurant
      </p>
      <p>Hmmm… Adding ~에게/한테 to a person, and adding ~에 to a non-person. What does this remind you of? Remember, you
        learned this same rule in Lesson 14 when predicating sentences with passive verbs.</p>
      <p>Well, 실망하다 is a verb. In English, it definitely feels like an adjective, but in Korean the dictionary (and the
        use of the particles ~에게/한테 and ~에) indicate that it is a verb. Here, 실망하다 is a verb (much like passive verbs)
        that cannot act on an object. Other verbs like this are 자다 (to sleep), 죽다 (to die), etc. This really means very
        little, and the only thing you need to take from this is:</p>
      <p>In order to say one is disappointed, you can use 실망하다:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-17.mp3">저는 실망했어요</a> = I was
        disappointed<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-18.mp3">우리 아버지는 어제 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed yesterday
      </p>
      <p>In order to say one is disappointed in something/somebody, you can use 실망하다 along with the use of the particles
        ~에게/한테 (for a person) or ~에 (for a non-person). For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-19.mp3">저는 친구에게 실망했어요</a> = I
        was disappointed in my friend<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-20.mp3">우리 아버지는 저에게 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed in me
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-21.mp3">저는 영화에 실망했어요</a> = I was
        disappointed in the movie<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-22.mp3">우리 아버지는 식당에 실망했어요</a> =
        Our dad was disappointed in the restaurant
      </p>
      <p>Now, 실망스럽다 usually is not describing one’s emotions. Rather, it is describing something that has the
        “properties of disappointment.” This usually translates to “disappointing.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-29.mp3">결과는 조금 실망스러웠어요</a> = The
        result was a little bit disappointing<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-23.mp3">그 영화는 조금 실망스러웠어요</a> =
        The movie was a little bit disappointing
      </p>
      <p>That being said, you might sometimes hear 실망스럽다 being used like this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-27.mp3">저는 실망스러웠어요</a></p>
      <p>In this case, what do you think this would mean?</p>
      <p>I guess in theory this could sometimes mean “I am disappointing.” But very rarely would somebody say that. Most
        of the time, this sentence would translate to “I am disappointed.”</p>
      <p>Wait a second… I thought the word to describe one’s emotions as “disappointed” was “실망하다.” In this sentence,
        why is “실망스럽다” being used to describe the person’s emotions in this sentence.</p>
      <p>It’s not.</p>
      <p>If you heard the sentence “저는 실망스럽다” in Korean, it would most likely be from a person describing that
        <em>something </em>is disappoint<em>ing</em>, but they have omitted it from the sentence. For example, using the
        adjective “실망스럽다” you can use the Subject – Object – Adjective form in the following way:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-24.mp3">저는 친구가 실망스러워요</a> = I am
        disappointed in my friend<br />
        <em>(My friend is disappointing, and therefore I am disappointed)</em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-25.mp3">저는 학생들이 실망스러웠어요</a> = I
        was disappointed in the students<br />
        <em>(My students were disappointing, and therefore I was disappointed)</em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-26.mp3">저는 그 영화가 실망스러웠어요</a> = I
        was disappointed in the movie<br />
        <em>(The movie was disappointing, and therefore I was disappointed)</em>
      </p>
      <p>If you just walked into a room and said:</p>
      <p>저는 실망스러워요~ = I am disappointed (in something….)</p>
      <p>Whoever was listening to that sentence would probably say “In what?”<br />
        What the speaker has done when saying “저는 실망스러워요” is they have simply omitted the object that they are
        describing.</p>
      <p>Wow… that’s a lot of stuff to wrap your head around. Let’s break it down one more time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>실망하다 is a verb that describes one’s emotions of being disappointed:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-17.mp3">저는 실망했어요</a> = I was
          disappointed
        </li>
        <li>실망하다 cannot act on an object (like 자다, 죽다, or any passive verb). Therefore, the following is
          incorrect:<br />
          저는 학생을 실망했어요</li>
        <li>Instead, as with passive verbs, the use of ~에게/한테 should be used to indicate that you are disappointed in a
          person:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-19.mp3">저는 친구에게 실망했어요</a> = I
          was disappointed in my friend
        </li>
        <li>~에 can be used to indicate that you are disappointed in a non-person:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-21.mp3">저는 영화에 실망했어요</a> = I
          was disappointed in the movie
        </li>
        <li>실망스럽다 is an adjective that describes something which is disappointing:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-23.mp3">그 영화는 조금 실망스러웠어요</a> =
          The movie was a little bit disappointing
        </li>
        <li>The adjective 실망스럽다 can be used in the subject – object – adjective form to indicate that you were
          disappointed in something:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-26.mp3">저는 그 영화가 실망스러웠어요</a> =
          I was disappointed in that movie
        </li>
        <li>In the sentence above, the object can be omitted from the sentence, in which case the speaker is indicating
          that something was disappointing (and by virtue, he/she is disappointed), but has omitted the noun that is
          disappointing:<br />
          <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-27.mp3">저는 실망스러웠어요</a> = I was
          disappointed (something was disappointing…)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I realize that is incredibly confusing.</p>
      <p>This same phenomenon happens with the word 만족스럽다. Look at the following three words:</p>
      <p>만족 = satisfaction<br />
        만족하다 = to be satisfied<br />
        만족스럽다 = “with the properties of satisfaction” (satisfactory)</p>
      <p>Just like with 실망하다, 만족하다 is used to describe a person’s emotions. This could be referring to anybody’s
        emotions; not necessarily just the speaker’s emotions. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-28.mp3">저는 만족해요</a> = I am
        satisfied<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-29.mp3">그는 만족해요</a> = He is
        satisfied
      </p>
      <p>Again, just like with 실망스럽다, 만족스럽다 is <em>not </em>describing one’s emotions. Rather, it is an adjective that
        is describing something that has the “properties of satisfaction.” This usually translates to “satisfactory.”
        For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-37.mp3">결과는 만족스러웠어요</a> = The
        results were satisfactory</p>
      <p>만족스럽다 can be used in the Subject – Object – Adjective form to indicate that one is satisfied in something. For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-30.mp3">저는 결과가 만족스러웠어요</a> = I
        was satisfied with the results<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-31.mp3">저는 음식이 만족스러웠어요</a> = I
        was satisfied with the food
      </p>
      <p>In this Subject – Object – Adjective form, the object can be omitted and the speaker can indicate that
        <em>something</em> was satisfactory (and thus he/she was satisfied). For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-40.mp3">저는 만족스러웠어요</a> = I was
        satisfied (something was satisfying…)</p>
      <p>Don’t worry too much about the difference between words like 실망하다 vs. 실망스럽다 and 만족하다 vs. 만족스럽다. I’m really
        going deep into this, and it is not something you really need to worry about as most Korean people wouldn’t know
        the difference unless they really think about it.</p>
      <p>In other words with -스럽다, the difference is much less ambiguous because the -스럽다 version of the word is an
        adjective, but the –하다 version is a verb that <em>can</em> act on an object. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-32.mp3">저는 그 여자를 사랑해요</a> = I
        love that girl<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-33.mp3">그 여자는 사랑스러워요</a> = That
        girl is lovely
      </p>
      <p>Another good example of –스럽다 is:</p>
      <p>자랑하다 = to show off (verb)<br />
        자랑스럽다 = proud (adjective)</p>
      <p>Here as well, 자랑하다 is a verb that can act on a noun, so its usage is very simple:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-34.mp3">저는 저의 한국어 실력을 자랑했어요</a> =
        I showed off/boasted my Korean skills
      </p>
      <p>자랑스럽다 is usually used in the Subject – Object – Adjective form to indicate who somebody is proud of. For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-35.mp3">저는 저의 딸이 아주 자랑스러워요</a> =
        I am very proud of my daughter<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-36.mp3">저는 학생들이 자랑스러워요</a> = I am
        proud of the students
      </p>
      <p>It’s also good to recognize that because all of these ~스럽다 words are adjectives, they can also describe an
        upcoming noun (just like any other adjective) by placing ~ㄴ/은 to the stem of the word. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-37.mp3">우리 딸은 사랑스러운 여자예요</a> =
        Our daughter is a loving/lovely girl</p>
      <p>Also, ~게 can be added to the end of the stem of –스럽다 to change the word into an adverb. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson16-47.mp3">그는 한국어를 자연스럽게 말해요</a> =
        he speaks Korean naturally<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-38.mp3">저는 그를 사랑스럽게 봤어요</a> = I
        looked at him lovingly<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-39.mp3">그는 실망스럽게 행동했어요</a> = He
        acted disappointingly (in a disappointing way)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-16-40.mp3">저는 일을 만족스럽게 끝냈어요</a> = I
        finished the work/job satisfactorily (in a satisfactory way)
