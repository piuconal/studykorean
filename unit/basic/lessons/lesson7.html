        <p>Examples: 그 사람의 <strong>눈썹</strong>은 짙어요 = That person’s <strong>eyebrows</strong> are thick<br />
          저도 그런 <strong>눈썹</strong>이 있었으면 좋겠어요 = I wish I had that type of <strong>eyebrows</strong>, too

      <div id="target-id67835b70afdf4" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Notes: 교사 refers more to the position of a teacher. You would usually refer to a teacher by calling him/her
          “선생님.” However, if you wanted to tell somebody what your position was, you could use 교사 (선생님 would also work
          here as well)</p>
        <p>Examples: 저는 영어<strong>교사</strong>예요 = I am an English <strong>teacher</strong></p>
        <p>대학교 때 자유롭게 공부하고 싶으면 지도<strong>교사</strong>가 전공을 나중에 선택하라고 말했어요<br />
          = If you want to study freely in university, my <strong>guidance</strong> <strong>counselor</strong> told me

      <div id="target-id67835b70afe29" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>The pronunciation of this word is closer to “직짱”</p>
        <p>Notes: In English, we say “work” to refer to <em>what </em>is being done and <em>where </em>it is being done.
          For example “I am doing work at work.” 직장 refers to the location in which you work.</p>
        <p>Examples: 그는 <strong>직장</strong>에서 일찍 퇴근했어요 = He left <strong>work</strong> early<br />
          <strong>직장</strong>에서 더 멀리 이사하게 되었어요 = I ended up moving farther away from <strong>work<br />
          </strong>학업을 진행하면서 <strong>직장</strong>도 다녀요 = As I progress/continue my studies, I also go to

          = I am going to the beach tomorrow, so I have no choice but to shave my <strong>armpit hair</strong></p>
        <p>기린의 <strong>털</strong> 때문에 기린이 노란색 옷을 입은 것 같이 보였다. 나는 기린이 목이 길어서 무서울 줄 알았는데 오히려 귀여웠다.<br />
          = Because of their <strong>fur</strong>, it looked like the giraffes were wearing yellow clothes. Giraffes

        <p>Notes: In English, the words “looking for/searching” and “find” have a similar meaning but are used
          differently. We use “find” <em>after </em>something is found. However, before something is found we use “look
          for/search.” In Korean, the 찾다 is used for both of these usages. This confusion often leads Korean people to
          incorrectly say things like “I am finding my brother.”</p>

          저는 저의 지갑을 <strong>찾</strong>고 있어요 = I am <strong>looking</strong> for my wallet<br />

          one misses something. It is more commonly used when one misses a non-person. As an adjective, it must get
          treated as one. Therefore, in order to say that one misses something, it is commonly used in the Subject –
          Object – Adjective form that is taught in Lesson 15.</p>

        <p>Notes: 일찍 is an adverb. The opposite of “early” is typically 늦다 which is an adjective. 늦게 can be used as the
          adverb to have the meaning of “late.” For example:<br />
          우리는 일찍 도착했어요 = We arrived early<br />
          우리는 늦게 도착했어요 = We arrived late (it would be awkward to say “lately” in English)</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          우리는 내일 <strong>일찍</strong> 일어나야 돼요 = We need to wake up <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning<br />
          왜 이렇게 <strong>일찍</strong> 가요? = Why are you going so <strong>early</strong> (like this)?<br />
          제가 <strong>일찍</strong> 가도 돼요? = May I go <strong>early</strong>?<br />

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Irregulars</span></p>
      <p>As with all languages, there are some irregular conjugations that you need to know. Irregulars are applied to
        certain verbs or adjectives when adding something to the stem of the word. Korean grammar is based on these
        “additions” that are added to stems. I mentioned this in <a
          title="Lesson 5: Korean Conjugation: Past, Present, Future"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lesson 5</a>, but I want to
        reiterate it here.</p>
      <p>There are hundreds of additions that you can add to the stem of a verb or adjective. Some of these additions
        are conjugations and some of them are grammatical principles that have meaning in a sentence.</p>
      <p>You have learned about some of these additions now. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>~ㄴ/는다 to conjugate to the plain form</li>
        <li>~아/어 to conjugate to the informal low respect form</li>
        <li>~아/어요 to conjugate to the informal high respect form</li>
        <li>~ㅂ/습니다 to conjugate to the formal high respect form</li>
        <li>~았/었어 to conjugate to the informal low respect form in the past tense</li>
        <li>~ㄴ/은 added to an adjective to describe an upcoming noun</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In future lessons, you will learn about many more of these additions. For example, some of them are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>~ㄴ/은 후에 to mean “after”</li>
        <li>~기 전에 to mean “before”</li>
        <li>~기 때문에 to mean “because”</li>
        <li>~아/어서 to mean “because”</li>
        <li>~(으)면 to mean “when”</li>
        <li>~아/어야 하다 to mean “one must”</li>
        <li>~아/어서는 안 되다 to mean “one should not”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notice that some of these additions start with a vowel, and some of them start with a consonant. Most of the
        irregulars are applied when adding a vowel to a stem. The ㄹ irregular that is introduced at the end of the
        lesson is the only irregular that applies when adding a consonant to a stem.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at one example before I introduce each irregular one by one. Let’s say we want to conjugate the word
        “어렵다” into the past tense using the informal low respect form. The following would happen:</p>
      <p>어렵다 + ~았/었어 = 어려웠어</p>
      <p>Here, you can see that the actual <em>stem </em>of the word changed. This is referred to as the “ㅂ irregular”
        because the same phenomenon happens with many (but not all) words whose stem ends in “ㅂ”.</p>
      <p>As I mentioned previously, most of these irregulars are applied when adding a vowel to a stem. There are many
        additions that start with a vowel, and you got a start on learning some of those conjugations in <a
          title="Lesson 5: Korean Conjugation: Past, Present, Future"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-5/">Lessons 5</a> and <a
          title="Lesson 6: Korean Honorifics"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">6</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>~아/어</li>
        <li>~아/어요</li>
        <li>~았/었어</li>
        <li>~았/었어요</li>
        <li>~았/었습니다</li>
        <li>~았/었다</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As such, this lesson will present the Korean irregulars and how they change as a result of adding these
        conjugations. In later lessons when you learn about other additions, you can apply what you learned in this
        lesson to those concepts. For now, let’s get started.</p>
      <h3><a name="ㅅi"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㅅ Irregular</span></p>
      <p>If the last letter of a word stem ends in ㅅ (for example: 짓다 = to build), the ㅅ gets removed when adding a
        vowel. For example, when conjugating:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">짓다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> = to
          make/build</span><br />
        짓 + 어 = 지어<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-1-I-build-a-house.mp3">나는 집을
          지어</a> = I build a house
      </p>
      <p>짓 + 었어요 = 지었어요<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-2-I-built-a-house.mp3">저는 집을
          지었어요</a> = I built a house
      </p>
      <p>Notice that this only happens when adding a vowel. When conjugating to the plain form, for example, you only
        add “~는다” to a stem and thus ㅅ does not get removed. For example:</p>
      <p>집을 짓는다 = to build a house</p>
      <p>The reason this irregular is done is to avoid changing the sound of a word completely after conjugating it.</p>
      <p>Pronouncing 짓다 sounds like ‘jit-da.’<br />
        Pronouncing 지어 sounds like ‘ji-uh’<br />
        Pronouncing 짓어 sounds like ‘jis-suh’</p>
      <p>The third one (which is incorrect) completely changes the sound of the word stem when a vowel is added (from
        ‘jit’ to ‘jis.’ Whereas in the second one, the sound of the word stem only changes from ‘jit’ to ‘ji,’ which is
        much smaller of a difference (especially considering the ‘t’ in the pronunciation of 짓 is not aspirated &#8211;
        which makes it barely audible). I know that is confusing, but if you can’t understand <em>why </em>it is done,
        that’s fine. Just know that it must be done.</p>
      <p>Some other examples of words that follow this irregular are (these words are too difficult for you right now,
        but I&#8217;m just showing you):</p>
      <p>낫다 = better (adjective) &#8211; You will learn more about this word in <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-19/#comp31">Lesson 19<br />
        </a>잇다 = to continue (verb)</p>
      <p>Common words that this does not apply to are:</p>
      <p>웃다 (to laugh) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-3-I-laughed.mp3">저는 웃었어요</a> = I
        laughed<br />
        벗다 (to take off clothes) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-4-I-took-off-my-clothes.mp3">저는 저의
          옷을 벗었어요</a> = I took off my clothes<br />
        씻다 (to wash) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-1-I-washed-my-hands.mp3">저는 저의 손을
          씻었어요</a> = I washed my hands</p>
      <p>Here is a table with the word &#8220;짓다 (to build)&#8221; being conjugated using all the honorific forms you
        have learned so far. The irregular conjugations are in bold. Notice that this only occurs when ~아/어 (or one of
        its derivatives like ~았/었어요) is added to the verb stem.</p>

      <h3><a name="ㄷi"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㄷ irregular</span></p>
      <p>If the last letter of a word stem ends in ㄷ (for example: 걷다 = to walk), the ㄷ gets changed to ㄹ when adding a
        vowel. This is only done with verbs. For example:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">걷다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> = to
          walk</span><br />
        걷 + 어 = 걸어<br />

        walked
      </p>
      <p>I don’t mean to confuse you, but I will:</p>
      <p>걷다 means “to walk.” When conjugating, by adding a vowel it changes to 걸어<br />
        Another meaning of 걷다 is “to tuck.” But this meaning of 걷다 does not follow the irregular rule. So when
        conjugating by adding a vowel, it simply stays as 걷어.<br />
        걸다 means “to hang.” When conjugating, by adding a vowel it stays as 걸어</p>
      <p>Confusing enough? Let&#8217;s look at all three:</p>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

      <p>Honestly, though, the whole 걷다/걷다/걸다 thing is probably the most confusing part of this conjugation, and don’t
        worry too much about it. “Walk” is a word that is used much more frequently than “tuck,” so it is not something
        that comes up a lot.</p>
      <p>The reason this conjugation is done is simply because the sounds flows off your tongue better. It is similar to
        pronouncing the word “butter” in English. When pronouncing “butter” we don’t say “butt-tter,” we just say
        “bud-er.” Like the ㄷ irregular, it is simply to avoid saying a hard consonant.</p>
      <p>This is done to most stems ending in ㄷ. Common words that this does not apply to (like 걷다 = to tuck) are:</p>
      <p>받다 (to get/receive) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-7-Received-money.mp3">돈을 받았어요</a> =

      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">귀엽다 = cute</span><br />
        귀엽 + 어요 = 귀여 + 우 + 어요 = 귀여워요<br />

      </p>
      <p>In the words “돕다” (to help) and “곱다” (an uncommon way to say “beautiful”) ㅂ changes to 오 instead of 우. For
        example:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">돕다 = to help</span><br />
        돕 + 았어요 = 도 + 오 + 았어요 = 도왔어요<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-10-I-helped-my-mother.mp3">저는 저의
          어머니를 도왔어요</a> = I helped my mother
      </p>
      <p><em>Note: The </em>ㅂ<em> in </em>돕다<em> and </em>곱다 <em>changes to </em>오<em> only when </em>~아/어 <em>(or any
          derivative like </em>~았/었다<em> or </em>~아/어요<em>) is added. When adding any other vowel, </em>ㅂ<em> changes to
        </em>우<em>. As of now, you haven’t learned when you would need to add a different vowel. For example, in future
          lessons you will learn about adding ~</em>ㄹ/을<em> to verbs. When this gets added to </em>돕다<em>, it changes to
        </em>도울<em>. This isn’t immediately pressing to you now, but you should make a mental note of it. </em></p>
      <p>Because the ㅂ irregular is found in adjectives, you will be conjugating it not only at the end of a sentence,
        but also in the middle of a sentence (before a noun). Remember the difference between these two sentences.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-4-Apples-are-big.mp3">사과는 크다</a>
        = Apples are big<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-5-I-like-big-apples.mp3">나는 큰 사과를
          좋아한다</a> = I like big apples
      </p>
      <p>In the first sentence, ‘big’ is an adjective that describes the noun (apple) at the end of the sentence.<br />
        In the second, ‘big’ <i>describes</i> the apple (as ‘a big apple’) and then “like” acts on the noun. In Lesson
        4, you learned how to describe a noun by placing an adjective with ~ㄴ/은 before it. Adding ~ㄴ/은 to adjectives
        where the stem ends in “ㅂ” causes this irregular to come into play.</p>
      <p>When placing an adjective (who&#8217;s stem ends in &#8220;ㅂ&#8221;) before a noun to describe it, you add ~ㄴ
        to the newly formed 우/오 syllable:</p>
      <p>귀엽 + ㄴ = 귀여 + 우 + ㄴ = 귀여운<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/12-I-like-cute-girls.mp3">저는 귀여운 여자를
          좋아해요</a> = I like cute girls
      </p>
      <p>More examples:<br />
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">쉽다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> =
          easy</span><br />
        쉽 + ㄴ = 쉬 + 우 + ㄴ = 쉬운<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/13-I-did-easy-work.mp3">저는 쉬운 일을 했어요</a> =
        I did easy work
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">부드럽다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> =
          soft</span><br />
        부드럽 + ㄴ = 부드러 + 우 + ㄴ = 부드러운<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-6-I-have-soft-hands.mp3">나는 부드러운
          손이 있어</a>= I have soft hands
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">춥다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> =
          cold</span><br />
        춥 + ㄴ = 추 + 우 + ㄴ = 추운<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15-I-like-cold-weather.mp3">저는 추운 날씨를
          좋아해요</a> = I like cold weather
      </p>
      <p>Note that in most irregulars, the word changes differently if the last vowel in the stem is ㅗ OR ㅏ. However, in
        the ㅂ irregular, except for 돕다 and 곱다, all applicable words are changed by adding 우. Therefore, even in words
        where the last vowel in the stem is ㅏ (ex: 아름답다) or ㅗ (ex: 새롭다), 우 is added. For example:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 아름답다 = beautiful</span>:<br />
        아름답 + 어요 = 아름다 + 우 + 어요 = 아름다워요<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-7-That-girl-is-beautiful.mp3">그
          여자는 아름다워요</a> = That girl is beautiful
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">새롭다 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">=
          new</span><br />
        새롭 + 어요 = 새로 + 우 + 어요 = 새로워요<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-8-That-school-is-new.mp3">그 학교는
          새로워요</a> = That school is new<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-9-That-is-a-new-school.mp3">그것은
          새로운 학교예요</a> = That (thing) is a new school
      </p>
      <p>Probably the most confusing of all irregulars, mainly because it seems strange that ㅂ can change to 우/오. The
        reason this happens is similar to the ㅅ irregular. As you know already, when pronouncing a syllable with the
        last letter ㅂ, you don’t really pronounce the ‘B’ sound. If you don’t know what I mean, check out the <a
          title="Unit 0: Pronunciation Tips" href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/?page_id=197">Pronunciation
          guide</a>. But, if you add a vowel after ㅂ the sound of ‘B’ would be pronounced. The purpose of the irregular
        is to eliminate the ‘B’ sound which isn’t actually in the word. Confusing? Yes, I know, but again, you don’t
        really need to care about <em>why</em> it is done.</p>
      <p>This is done to some words ending in ㅂ. Some common words in which this does not apply:</p>
      <p>좁다 (narrow) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-10-This-room-is-small.mp3">이 방은
          좁아요</a> = This room is narrow<br />
        잡다 (to catch/grab) = <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-12-I-caught-the-ball.mp3">저는 공을
          잡았어요</a> = I caught the ball<br />
        넓다 (wide) <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-11-This-room-is-wide.mp3">이 방은
          넓어요</a> = This room is wide<br />
        (Korean people often describe a room/place being “big” by saying it is “wide”)</p>
      <p>Here is a table with the word &#8220;춥다 (cold)&#8221; being conjugated using all the honorific forms you have
        learned so far. The irregular conjugations are in bold. Notice that this only occurs when ~아/어 (or one of its
        derivatives like ~았/었어요) is added to the verb stem.</p>

      <h3><a name="ㅡi"></a></h3>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㅡ Irregular</span></p>
      <p>If the final letter in a stem is ㅡ (for example: 잠그다 = to lock), when adding ~아/어, you can not determine
        whether you need to add ~어 or ~아 to the stem by looking at ㅡ. Instead, you must look at the vowel in the second
        last syllable. For example, in the word 잠그다, the second last syllable in the stem is 잠, and the vowel here is ㅏ.
        We use the same rules as above to determine whether 아 or 어 is added. If the vowel in the second last syllable is
        ㅏ or ㅗ, 아 is added. If the vowel in the second last syllable is anything other than ㅏ or ㅗ, 어 is added. For
        example:</p>
      <p>Where the vowel in the second last syllable is ㅏ or ㅗ:<br />
        잠그다 + ~아/어<br />
        = 잠그아</p>
      <p>Where the vowel in the second last syllable is anything butㅏ or ㅗ:<br />
        슬프다 + ~아/어<br />
        = 슬프어</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that is not all that happens. When ~아/어 is added to a stem where the last letter is ㅡ, ~아/어
        merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated. That is quite confusing, so let&#8217;s look at examples of how this
        is done.</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잠그다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> = to
          lock</span><br />
        This stem ends in ㅡ. If we were to add ~아/어, we need to look at the second last syllable, which is 잠. The vowel
        in this syllable is ㅏ, so ~아 needs to be added to the stem.<br />
        잠그 + 아<br />
        ~아 merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated:<br />
        잠그 + 아 = 잠가</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">바쁘다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> = to be
          busy</span><br />
        This stem ends in ㅡ. If we were to add ~아/어, we need to look at the second last syllable, which is 바. The vowel
        in this syllable is ㅏ, so ~아 needs to be added to the stem.<br />
        바쁘 + 아<br />
        ~아 merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated:<br />
        바쁘 + 아 = 바빠</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">예쁘다 = pretty<br />
        </span>This stem ends in ㅡ. If we were to add ~아/어, we need to look at the second last syllable, which is 예. The
        vowel in this syllable is not ㅏ or ㅗ, so ~어 needs to be added to the stem.<br />
        예쁘 + 어<br />
        ~어 merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated:<br />
        예쁘 + 어 = 예뻐</p>
      <p><u>슬프다</u><u> = to be sad<br />
        </u>This stem ends in ㅡ. If we were to add ~아/어, we need to look at the second last syllable, which is 슬. The
        vowel in this syllable is not ㅏ or ㅗ, so ~어 needs to be added to the stem.<br />
        슬프 + 어<br />
        ~어 merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated:<br />
        슬프 + 어 = 슬퍼<u><br />
        </u></p>
      <p>This merging of ~아/어 to the stem occurs when ~아/어 is added, or any of its derivatives, including ~아/어요 and past
        tense conjugations like ~았/었어 or ~았/었어요. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/16-I-locked-the-door.mp3">저는 문을 잠갔어요</a> =
        I locked the door<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/17-I-am-busy.mp3">저는 바빠요</a> = I am
        busy<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-13-That-girl-is-pretty.mp3">그 여자는
          예뻐요</a> = That girl is pretty<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-15-I-am-very-sad.mp3">저는 아주
          슬퍼요</a> = I am very sad
      </p>
      <p>Some stems only have one syllable. For example, the stem of 크다 is just 크. In this case, we know that we need to
        use the ㅡ irregular, but there is no previous syllable to draw on to determine what should be added to the stem.
        In these cases, ~어 is added to the stem. For example:</p>
      <p><u>크다</u><u> = to be big<br />
        </u>This stem ends in ㅡ. If we were to add ~아/어, we need to look at the second last syllable, but there is none,
        so ~어 needs to be added to the stem.<br />
        크 + 어<br />
        ~어 merges to the stem and the ㅡ is eliminated:<br />
        크 + 어 = 커<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s1.mp3">그 집은 커요</a> = That house
        is big
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes the last <em>vowel</em> of a stem is ㅡ, but the stem ends in a consonant. In these cases, there is no
        merging and ~어 is always chosen instead of ~아. For example:</p>
      <p><u>긁다</u><u> = to scratch</u><br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅡ. However, the stem does not end in ㅡ and instead ends with a consonant.
        Therefore, 어 is added.<br />
        긁 + 어요 = 긁어요<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Lesson-7-14-I-scratched-my-head.mp3">저는 머리를
          긁었어요</a> = I scratched my head
      </p>
      <p><u>듣다</u><u> = to hear</u><br />
        The last vowel in the stem is ㅡ. However, the stem does not end in ㅡ and instead ends with a consonant.
        Therefore, 어 is added.<br />
        듣 + 었어요 = 듣었어요</p>
      <p>But wait! Don’t forget the ㄷ irregular.</p>
      <p>듣 + 었다 = 들었다<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/18-I-heard-a-mouse.mp3">저는 쥐를 들었어요</a> = I
        heard a mouse
      </p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">만들다 = to make<br />
        </span>The last vowel in the stem is ㅡ. However, the stem does not end in ㅡ and instead ends with a consonant.
        Therefore, 어 is added. Regardless of what the vowel in the previous stem is, because the stem ends in a
        consonant, 어 is added.<br />
        만들다 + ~아/어요<br />
        = 만들어요</p>

      <h3><a name="르i"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">르 Irregular</span></p>
      <p>If the final syllable in a stem is 르 (마르다), it is conjugated differently when adding ~아/어. This irregular only
        applies when adding ~아/어(or any of its derivatives) to a stem and not when adding any other grammatical
        principles that starts with a vowel or consonant. Up until now, you haven&#8217;t learned about any of these
        other grammatical principles, that can start with anything other than ~아/어~, so don&#8217;t worry about this
        distinction too much.</p>
      <p>When adding ~아/어 to these words, an additional ㄹ is created and placed in the syllable preceding 르 as the last
        consonant. The 르 also gets changed to either 러 or 라 (depending on if you are adding 어 or 아). This is done to
        both verbs and adjectives (the only exceptions are 따르다 = to follow/to pour; and 푸르다 = to be calming blue). This
        is difficult to explain, and much easier to show with examples:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">다르다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> = different
        </span><br />
        다르 + 아요 = 다 + ㄹ + 라요 = 달라요<br />

      <h3><a name="ㄹi"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㄹ Irregular</span></p>
      <p>Okay, last one, I promise.</p>
      <p>As you know, there are times when you must choose between two things to add to a stem. For example:</p>
      <p>~아/어 means you must choose between adding ~아 or ~어<br />
        ~ㄴ/은 means you must choose between adding ~ㄴ or ~은<br />
        ~ㅂ/습 means you must choose between adding ~ㅂ or ~습<br />
        ~ㄹ/을 means you must choose between adding ~ㄹ or ~을</p>
      <p>As you know, you choose the correct addition based on the stem.</p>
      <p>If the final letter of a stem is ㄹ AND you add any of the following:</p>
      <p>~ㄴ/은<br />
        ~ㄴ/는<br />
        ~ㅂ/습<br />
        ~ㄹ/을</p>
      <p>The first option (~ㄴ/ ~ㅂ / ~ㄹ ) should be used. In addition, the ㄹ is removed from the stem and the ~ㄴ / ~ㅂ /
        ~ㄹ is added directly to the stem. Let&#8217;s look at each one individually.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㄹ Irregular: Adding ~ㄴ/은 to
          words</span></p>
      <p>You have learned about adding ~ㄴ/은 to adjective stems when describing nouns. Usually, you add ~ㄴ directly to
        the stem of an adjective ending in a vowel, and ~은 to the stem of an adjective ending in a consonant, for
        example:</p>
      <p>크다 = 큰 남자<br />
        작다 = 작은 남자</p>
      <p>When adding ~ㄴ/은 to a stem which ends in ㄹ, the ㄹ is removed and ㄴ is added to the stem:</p>
      <p>길다 = long<br />
        길 + ㄴ = 긴<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20-I-crossed-the-long-street.mp3">저는 긴 거리를
          건넜어요</a> = I crossed the long street
      </p>
      <p>멀다 = far away<br />
        멀 + ㄴ = 먼<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/21-I-went-to-a-far-away-hospital.mp3">저는 먼
          병원에 갔어요</a> = I went to a far away hospital (a hospital that is far away)
      </p>
      <p>There will be times when you have to add ~ㄴ/은 to verbs stems as well, but you haven&#8217;t learned about this
        yet. I introduce this concept in <a title="Lesson 26: ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lesson
          26</a>, and then talk about the irregular being applied in <a title="Lesson 28: Anomalies with ~는 것"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-28/">Lesson
          28</a>. I don&#8217;t want you to think about this too much until those lessons, but just so you know, the
        concept is the same as adding ~ㄴ/은 to an adjective. For example:</p>
      <p>열다 = to open<br />
        열 + ㄴ = 연</p>
      <p>Although you haven&#8217;t learned about adding ~ㄴ/은 to stems, you <em>have</em> learned about adding ~ㄴ/는다 to
        verb stems. Normally, you add ~ㄴ다 to the stem of a verb ending in a vowel, and ~는다 to the stem of a verb ending
        in a consonant. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 집에 간다 = I go home<br />
        나는 밥을 먹는다 = I eat rice</p>
      <p>But when adding ~ㄴ/는다 to a verb stem that ends in ㄹ, you must remove ㄹ and add ~ㄴ다 to the verb stem:</p>
      <p>나는 문을 연다 = I open the door<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-25-I-make-a-cake.mp3">나는 케이크를
          만든다</a> = I make a cake
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ㄹ Irregular: Adding ~ㅂ/습 to
          words</span></p>
      <p>You have also learned about adding ~ㅂ/습니다 to verb and adjective stems when conjugating in the Formal high
        respect form: Normally, you add ~ㅂ니다 to the stem of a word ending in a vowel, and ~습니다 to the stem of a word
        ending in a consonant. For example:</p>
      <p>Verbs:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s2.mp3">저는 집에 갑니다</a> = I go
        home<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s3.mp3">저는 밥을 먹습니다</a> = I eat
        rice
      </p>
      <p>Adjectives:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s4.mp3">그 여자는 예쁩니다</a> = That girl
        is pretty<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s5.mp3">이 방은 넓습니다</a> = This room
        is big/wide
      </p>
      <p>But when adding ~ㅂ니다 to the stem of a word that ends in ㄹ, you must remove ㄹ and add ~ㅂ directly to the stem.
        For example:</p>
      <p>Verbs:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/24-I-open-the-door.mp3">저는 문을 엽니다</a> = I
        open the door<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-7-s6.mp3">저는 케이크를 만듭니다</a> = I make
        a cake
      </p>
      <p>Adjectives:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/26-That-hospital-is-far.mp3">그 병원은 멉니다</a>
        = That hospital is far<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-7-27-That-girls-hair-is-long.mp3">그
          여자의 머리카락은 깁니다</a> = That girls hair is long
      </p>
      <p><em>머리 can mean ‘head’ or ‘hair’ depending on the context. If you want to specifically mention your hair, you
          can say 머리카락, which always means the hair on one&#8217;s head. 머리 or 머리카락 does not refer to the hair on an
          animal, or the body hair of a human. This hair is referred to as “털” and extends to most of the hair that can
          be found on animals (fur, the wool on a sheep, etc).</em></p>
      <p>The addition of ~ㅂ/습니다 only affects words that end in ㄹ. There is no irregular that occurs if adding ~ㅂ/습니다 to
        any other type of stem. For example, notice how only the stem of 길다 changes as a result of adding this:</p>

      <p>And here is a table with the word &#8220;길다 (long &#8211; which is an adjective)&#8221; being conjugated using
        all the honorific forms you have learned so far. Notice that this only occurs when ~ㄴ or ~ㅂ is added to the verb
        stem (it would happen when ~ㄴ is added, but you don&#8217;t add ~ㄴ/는 to an adjective when you conjugate it like
        this. There are times, however, when this would happen, but you haven&#8217;t even gotten close to learning
        about them yet. For example, in <a title="Lesson 76: ~는데 and ~는 데 in Korean"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/upper-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-4-lessons-76-83/lesson-76/">Lesson
          76</a>, we talk about the addition of ~ㄴ/는데 to clauses. This would make 길다 turn into 긴데. Please don&#8217;t
        even think about looking ahead to <a title="Lesson 76: ~는데 and ~는 데 in Korean"

      <p>I don’t want to confuse you too much more because I am sure you are already really confused. Just the amount of
        content on this page alone is enough to make somebody cry. That being said, I think it is a very good exercise
        to try to compare how the words 듣다 and 들다 differ in their conjugations. Don’t worry about the meaning of 들다 yet
        (it is a very complex word that has many meanings), but just assume it is a verb in this case. For now, let’s
        just focus on how they are conjugated.</p>
      <p>Notice that when conjugating 듣다, you need to consider the following irregular patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ㄷ irregular (because it ends in ㄷ)</li>
        <li>ㅡ irregular (because the final vowel is ㅡ)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I feel that comparing these two is a very good exercise because you can see that sometimes, because of the
        irregular conjugations, 듣다 might look exactly like 들다. For example, in all of the past tense conjugations, there
        is no way to distinguish between the two based on sound, and the only way to distinguish them is by context in a
        sentence.</p>
      <p>There is no easy way around memorizing stuff like this. The only words of encouragement I can give you is that
        – as you become more and more familiar with the language, and as you expose yourself to it more and more, it
        <em>does </em>become second nature. I know you can’t believe that now, but it does.

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adding ~ㄴ/은 to Adjectives</span></p>
      <p>I mentioned this in some of the sections above, but I would like to organize it all here. In <a
          title="Lesson 4: Korean Adjectives ~ㄴ/은"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-4/">Lesson 4</a>, you learned
        how to add ~ㄴ/은 to adjectives to describe an upcoming noun. Some irregulars will come into play when doing this
        because of the possibility of adding a vowel to a stem. Let’s look at the word “어렵다” as an example. 어렵다 has a
        consonant as its final letter, which means that ~은 must be added (instead of ~ㄴ). Therefore, we end up with:</p>
      <p>어렵은</p>
      <p>Because of this, we now have the final consonant “ㅂ” followed by a vowel, which causes the ㅂ irregular to be
        applied. The correct conjugation of 어렵다 + ~ㄴ/은 is therefore “어려운.”</p>
      <p>Below is a table that shows how irregular adjectives can change because of adding ~ㄴ/은:</p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Looking Ahead to Grammatical Principles
          that you will Learn in Future Lessons</span></p>
      <p>There are many additions that you will learn in future lessons. You will learn the meaning and usage of all of
        these when they become important for your level of study. When you learn about a new addition in a future
        lesson, I will explain how it causes irregular words to change.</p>
      <p>The good thing is – if you learn how one format of addition causes irregulars to change, every addition with
        the same initial letters will cause the same change. For example, adding ~아/어 causes ㅅ to be eliminated in words
        that follow the ㅅ irregular. Likewise, any other addition that <em>starts</em> with ~아/어 causes the same change.
        For example, if I add ~아/어 or ~았/었다 to 짓다, we see the same change to the word stem – that is 짓다 changes to 지어
        and 지었다 respectively.</p>
      <p>This same idea can be applied to grammatical additions that will be introduced in later lessons. For example,
        in Lesson 43 you will learn how ~(으)면 causes irregular words to change. The change that results from adding
        ~(으)면 is exactly the same as the change that results from adding similar additions like ~(으)며 and ~(으)면서.
        Therefore, you don’t need to memorize how each one affects irregulars, but rather how the general format of
        adding ~(으)ㅁ… will affect irregulars. I know the road ahead to memorizing these new additions and their effects
        on irregulars looks daunting, but this grouping of formats will allow your brain to compartmentalize the
        information.</p>
      <p>Each time a new format/style of addition is introduced in my lessons, I will explain how irregulars adapt to
        it. This only needs to be done once for each format, because each successive addition with the same format will
        create the same change to irregulars. Below is a list of grammatical principles you will learn in future
        lessons. Each one follows a particular style. In each of these lessons, I will explain how they cause irregular
        words to change. Furthermore, I will explain the other grammatical principles that follow the same format that
        will create the same change:</p>

      <p>For now, focus on the concepts that were introduced in this lesson. When you reach each of the lessons above, I
        will bring up the discussion of irregulars again. At that point, we can talk about how that grammatical
        principle causes irregular words to change.</p>
      <p><a title="Korean Irregulars – Quick Reference" href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/?page_id=448">Check out
          our Irregular Guide if you are confused (I’m sure you are!).</a></p>
      <p>Everybody is confused when they learn these irregulars. Eventually you will reach a point where all of these
        will come natural to you. Whenever you learn a new word where the stem ends in ㅅ/ㄹ/ㅂ/ㄷ/르/ㅡ just make a mental
        note about how you should conjugate that word in the future. I don’t even have to think about these irregulars
        anymore because they just flow out naturally. If you can’t memorize them all right now, just try to understand
        them, which will allow you to recognize them later. Eventually, you will memorize them simply from using and
        hearing them so much.</p>
