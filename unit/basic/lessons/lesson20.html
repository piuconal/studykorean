      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>Until now, you have not learned how to say “I am good at something/I do something well” or “I am bad at
        something/I do something poorly.” In this lesson, you will learn about the words 잘하다 (to do something well) and
        못하다 (to do something poorly). 못하다 is very hard to understand perfectly, so I will ease you in by introducing you
        to 잘하다 first.<br />
        <span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span>
      </p>
      <h3><a name="j1"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잘하다: To do something well<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>The main meaning of 잘하다 is “to do something well.” To use 잘하다, simply place a noun in a sentence with 잘하다 as
        the verb.</p>
      <p>This is easy to do with 하다 verbs (for example, 수영하다 and 공부하다) because to make a noun all you need to do is
        remove 하다 from those words. I discuss making non-하다 verbs into nouns in <a
          title="Lesson 26: ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lesson
          26</a>, but the principal is the same for any noun form of a verb. All you need to do is:</p>
      <p>나는 (noun form of verb)을/를 잘하다. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-1.mp3">나는 수영을 잘해</a> = I am good
        at swimming<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-2.mp3">저 학생은 공부를 잘해</a> = That
        student studies well<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-1.mp3">우리 애기는 말을 잘해요</a> = Our
        baby speaks well<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-2.mp3">저는 야구를 잘해요</a> = I play
        baseball well
      </p>
      <p>잘하다 is a verb, but now we need to talk about “잘,” which is an adverb.</p>
      <h3><a name="j2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잘: Well<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>Just like 잘하다, you can use the word 잘 in sentences to indicate that one does something well. Usually, when you
        remove 하다 from a word, the word without 하다 becomes a noun. In this case, removing 하다 from 잘 does not make 잘 a
        noun. Instead, it is an adverb. The only reason this is important is so that you know that you can use 잘 in
        sentences just like other adverbs, in this case to mean “(to do something) well.” It is essentially the same as
        &#8220;잘하다,&#8221; but used slightly different. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-5.mp3">그 주인은 고객님들을 잘 대우해요</a> =
        That owner treats the customers well<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-7.mp3">나는 어젯밤에 잘 잤어</a> = I slept
        well last night
      </p>
      <p>When I first learned about 잘하다 and 잘, I was trying to understand if these two sentences were the same:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-3.mp3">나는 공부를 잘해</a> = I study
        well<br />
        나는 잘 공부해 = I study well</p>
      <p>The answer: essentially, but not entirely.</p>
      <p>The difference is so subtle that you don’t really need to worry about it. However, when I learned this, I
        worried about it, so I think maybe you should worry about it too. The reason I say “don’t worry about it” is
        because now when I speak I can’t really distinguish the difference in meaning. The only way I could tell the
        difference is referring back to my old notes from 5 years ago. Nonetheless, there is a subtle difference:</p>
      <p>나는 공부를 잘한다 = I study well, or<br />
        “나는 (noun)을 잘한다” means that, in general, your ability to do something is good. However,</p>
      <p>나는 잘 공부한다 = I study well, or<br />
        “나는 잘 (verb)다” means that you can study well because of some situation (for example, maybe you have a test
        coming up and you are studying really hard because of that situation).</p>
      <p>But really, don’t get too caught up on the difference between the two. Especially since sometimes they look and
        sound almost exactly the same. If you separated 공부 and 하다 in the second example, you would get:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-3.mp3">나는 공부를 잘 해</a> = I study
        well, which sounds (and almost looks) exactly the same as:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-3.mp3">나는 공부를 잘해</a> = I study
        well
      </p>
      <p>Anyways, don’t worry about it too much.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You already know the word 잘생기다 means “handsome.” That word is actually 잘 and 생기다 put together. 생기다 has a lot of
        meanings, but putting 잘 and 생기다 together, it sort of means “to come out well.” The opposite is true for 못생기다 (to
        be ugly).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Always remember to not translate directly from English to Korean, as there are so many things that are not 100%
        the same in both languages. For example, in English, we would never say “I don’t know well,” but in Korean, it
        is very common to say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-4.mp3">저는 잘 모르겠어요</a>* = I don’t
        know (well)<br />
        <i>*Also notice that the future tense </i>모르다 <i>is used here. Even though it is in the present, </i>모르겠다<i> is
          used very commonly to indicate that you don’t know something – Even though it directly translates to “I will
          not know.”</i>
      </p>
      <h3><a name="j3"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">못하다: To do something poorly<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>Alright, this is where it gets hard. 잘하다 was easy. Let’s do this step by step.</p>
      <p>First of all, 못하다 has the opposite meaning of 잘하다 – so it can be used to indicate that one generally is poor at
        something. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-9.mp3">나는 수영을 못해</a> = I am bad
        at swimming<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-10.mp3">저 학생은 공부를 못해</a> = That
        student does not study well
      </p>
      <p>The difference between 못하다 and 못 is the same as the difference between 잘하다 and 잘. When you say a sentence like
        “나는 수영을 못해” it means that in general your ability to swim is bad. Because of this, you need to be careful about
        the type of verb you are using in this situation. For example, you couldn’t really use the verb “to eat” in this
        situation, because that would mean that “in general, my ability to eat is bad.” Instead, what you would probably
        want to say is that “I CAN eat, but because of some situation, I can’t really eat right now.” That is when you
        need to use 못 instead of 못하다.</p>
      <h3><a name="j4"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">못: Poorly<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>Using 못하다 and understanding the meaning it creates is quite simple, especially if you can understand how 잘하다 is
        used. If you use the adverb 못, the meaning depends on the situation. Here are two simple examples we can look
        at:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-20-s1.mp3">저는 어제 못 잤어요</a><br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-12.mp3">저는 어제 시험을 못 봤어요</a>
      </p>
      <p>This is where it gets unnecessarily confusing. Both of those sentences could have two meanings.</p>
      <p>The first example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-20-s1.mp3">저는 어제 못 잤어요</a> could
        mean either of the following:
      </p>
      <p>I didn’t sleep <em>well</em> last night because of some situation, or<br />
        I didn’t sleep last night because something prevented me from sleeping</p>
      <p>The second example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-12.mp3">저는 어제 시험을 못 봤어요</a> could
        mean either of the following:
      </p>
      <p>I did <em>poorly</em> on the exam yesterday because of some situation, or<br />
        I didn’t write the exam yesterday because something prevented me from doing so</p>
      <p><em>(My translations of &#8220;&#8230; One didn&#8217;t &#8230; because something prevented him/her from
          &#8230;&#8221; is often simply translated to &#8220;One couldn&#8217;t&#8221; or &#8220;One
          can&#8217;t.&#8221; These English terms are complex, and might be related to one not doing something because
          something prevented them or related to one&#8217;s ability. Another way to say &#8220;one
          couldn&#8217;t&#8221; or &#8220;one can&#8217;t&#8221; in Korean is by using </em>~ㄹ/을 수 없다<em> , which I
          discuss in </em><em><a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-42-50/lesson-45/">Lesson
            45</a>).</em></p>
      <p>Confusing? Let me say this again. When you put 못 in a sentence, it can indicate that one does something poorly
        (or not well) OR that one does not do something because something prevented him/her from doing it. When it has
        the second meaning (“I didn’t do”) it is the result of some situation preventing you.</p>
      <p>I want to take a minute to distinguish this from other negative sentences &#8211; specifically using 안 or ~지 않다
        which you learned in <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-8/">Lesson
          8</a>. When you use 안 or ~지 않다, there is no deeper meaning that &#8220;something prevented you from doing the
        action.&#8221; For example, if I said:</p>
      <p>저는 어제 시험을 안 봤어요, or<br />
        저는 어제 시험을 보지 않았어요</p>
      <p>I am just saying that I didn&#8217;t write the exam yesterday &#8211; as if yesterday specifically was <em>not
        </em>the day that I was supposed to write the exam anyway (or something like that). Why would I write the exam
        when it is not the exam day? Of course I wouldn&#8217;t. Nothing is <em>preventing </em>me from writing the
        exam. It&#8217;s just not the day to write the exam. It&#8217;s also possible that I just didn&#8217;t do the
        exam because I didn&#8217;t want to. Either way, nothing is preventing me from doing it, I just didn&#8217;t do
        it.</p>
      <p>However, if I say:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-12.mp3">저는 어제 시험을 못 봤어요</a></p>
      <p>It probably <em>was </em>the day to write the exam, but something prevented me from writing it. The thing that
        prevented me from writing it could be anything &#8211; it could have been that I had to go to a party with my
        wife, or it could of been that I had explosive diarrhea. Either way, both of those things (especially the
        latter) would prevent me from writing the exam.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
      <p>In order to explain this further, I can explain a <em>very </em>common mistake that English speakers make when
        speaking Korean.</p>
      <p>You don&#8217;t know how to ask questions yet (you&#8217;ll learn that in the next lesson), but imagine if
        somebody asks you</p>
      <p>&#8220;Did you hear what I say?&#8221; (내 말을 들었어?)</p>
      <p>English speakers learning Korean often respond with:</p>
      <p>아니. 안 들었어.</p>
      <p>However, if you say that, it&#8217;s kind of like you are specifically/purposely trying not to hear what the
        person said. Instead, you obviously <em>can </em>hear, but something prevented you from hearing the person.
        Maybe it was the loud TV, maybe it was the motorcycle driving by, or maybe it was your explosive diarrhea.
        Either way, something prevented you from hearing the person, so you should say:</p>
      <p>아니. 못 들었어. = No, I didn&#8217;t (couldn&#8217;t) hear (you)</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
      <p>But, how can you distinguish the difference between somebody saying “I did something poorly” and “I didn’t do
        something”? There are three ways I can teach you:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잘 못</span><br />
        If you really want to stress that you do something poorly, you can include 잘 before 못. This specifically
        indicates that you “don’t do something <strong>well</strong>” and removes the ambiguity of “I didn’t”:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-13.mp3">저는 어제 시험을 잘 못 봤어요</a> = I
        didn’t do good on the exam yesterday</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          The word being used</span><br />
        Sometimes, the word being used makes it clear which meaning you are trying to express. For example, if I said:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-14.mp3">저는 어제 학교에 못 갔어요</a>, This
        could have two meanings:</p>
      <p>1) I didn’t go to school yesterday because of some situation<br />
        2) I didn’t go to school well yesterday</p>
      <p>Which one of those two makes sense? In situations like this, it is easy to figure out which meaning is being
        used. Is it possible to “go somewhere well?” I don’t think so.</p>
      <p>A perfect real-world example of this is something that my co-worker said to me once. The school I work at was
        in the process of buying my plane ticket back home, and it happened to be really expensive (like, really
        expensive). My co-worker always wanted to go to Canada, but when she heard how much my plane ticket was, she
        said to herself “캐나다에 못 가겠다<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/캐나다에못가겠다.m4a">.</a>” The meaning of this
        sentence is not “she will go to Canada poorly” but rather “she can’t/won’t go to Canada because of some
        situation” (the ticket being too expensive).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Situation</span><br />
        Sometimes you just need to think about the context of the sentence to understand the meaning completely. For
        example, if you already knew for sure that a friend wrote the exam, and they later said “시험을 못 봤어요” – the
        sentence could only have one meaning (because you already knew that he/she wrote the exam).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Let’s look at some examples. If somebody said:<br />
        저는 밥을 못 먹어요</p>
      <p>This could technically mean two things. It could mean:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>That the person can&#8217;t eat (well)</li>
        <li>That the person won&#8217;t eat because of some situation (most likely because he/she is full/doesn&#8217;t
          like that particular food, etc&#8230;)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this case, the first possibility does not make sense because everybody (99.9% of the time) has the ability
        to eat. Therefore, this person is expressing that he/she is not going to eat because of some situation that is
        causing him/her to not want to eat.</p>
      <p>Another example:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-5.mp3">저는 답을 잘 못 썼어요</a>
      </p>
      <p>This sentence could really only mean one thing. Because of the use of “잘,” we know that the speaker is
        expressing that he/she did not do something <b>well. </b>Therefore, the sentence above translates to “I didn’t
        answer well.</p>
      <p>There is still another way that 못/못하다 can be used to have yet another similar meaning to what has been
        described so far.</p>
      <h3><a name="j5"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~지 못하다</span></p>
      <p>One more thing about 못하다. Similar in structure to ~지 않다, you can also write ~지 못하다 to have the same meaning as
        못. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-20-s1.mp3">저는 어제 못 잤어요</a>
        AND<br />
        저는 어제 자지 못했어요 have the same meaning (I didn’t sleep [well] last night)</p>
      <p>Remember that 못 and ~지 못하다 have the same meaning, which is subtly different than 를 못하다:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-16.mp3">저는 어제 못 공부했어요</a> = I
        didn’t study well yesterday/I couldn&#8217;t study yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-17.mp3">저는 어제 공부하지 못했어요</a> = I
        didn’t study well yesterday/I couldn&#8217;t study yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-18.mp3">저는 공부를 못해요</a> = I am bad
        at studying
      </p>
      <h3><a name="j6"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잘못</span></p>
      <p>To make all of this even more confusing, the word 잘못 (with no space between 잘 and 못) has a different meaning.
        잘못 means “mistake.” This word would normally be an easy word to deal with. However, it is more difficult than it
        needs to be because 잘못 and 잘 못 have two different meanings. 잘못 can be used like this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson20-19.mp3">그것은 제 잘못이었어요</a> = That
        was my fault/my mistake</p>
      <p><i>Normally when you say “my _____” you use </i>저의<i> or </i>나의<i>. However, some nouns prefer to have </i>제<i>
          and </i>내<i> before them instead of </i>저의/나의. 잘못<i> is one of these nouns. Another example is </i>제/내 생각<i>
          (instead of </i>저의/나의 생각<i>) meaning &#8220;my thought/my opinion/what I think.&#8221;</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">잘 and 못 with Comparatives and
          Superlatives</span></p>
      <p>One final thing before I finish. In the previous lesson, you learned about using ~보다 and 가장/제일 to make
        comparative and superlative sentences. The concepts you learned in this lesson are very commonly used alongside
        ~보다 or 가장/제일 in sentences to say that somebody can do something better/worse, or do something the best/worst.
        Some examples:</p>
      <p>Comparative Sentences:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-6.mp3">우리 아들은 친구들보다 축구를 더 잘해요</a>
        = Our (my) son is better than (his) friends at soccer<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-7.mp3">그 교수는 다른 교수들보다 수업을 더
          잘해요</a> = That professor teaches classes better than other professors<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-8.mp3">저는 수영을 작년보다 더 잘해요</a> = I
        am better at swimming than last year
      </p>
      <p>Superlative Sentences:<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-9.mp3">우리 아들은 축구를 가장 잘해요</a> =
        Our (my) son is the best at soccer<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-10.mp3">그 교수는 수업을 제일 잘해요</a> =
        That professor teaches classes the best (is the best at teaching classes)
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-11.mp3">저는 축구를 제일 못해요</a> = I
        play soccer the worst<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-20-12.mp3">저는 수영을 제일 못해요</a> = I
        swim the worst
      </p>
      <p><em>Again, in most situations, these sentences would sound more natural with the use of other grammatical
          principles. For example, to say “I am the one who plays soccer the worst” or “Of all people, I play soccer the
          worst.” To be able to wrap your head around those sentences, you’ll need to read/understand the grammar taught
          in <a title="Lesson 26: ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lessons
            26</a> and <a title="Lesson 33: ~중 (하는 중), (~중에)"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-33/">33</a>
          respectively. </em></p>
      <p>That&#8217;s it for this lesson!</p>
