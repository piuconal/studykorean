      <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to make comparative and superlative sentences in Korean. Using comparative
        sentences, you will learn how to make sentences like “I am more beautiful than you” or “he is faster than his
        brother.” Using superlative sentences, you will learn how to make sentences like “I am the most handsome person
        in the world.” In addition, we will take an in-depth look at the word 더, which is commonly used in comparative
        sentences. Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
      <h3><a name="comp2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><u>More: </u><u>더</u></p>
      <p>Before we even get into using comparatives, I want to make you familiar with the word 더, meaning “more” in
        English. The word ‘more’ (in English and Korean) is very commonly used in sentences when comparing things. For
        example:</p>
      <p>I am <em>more </em>handsome <u>than you</u></p>
      <p>In order to understand how 더 is used, let’s first look at sentences where it is not used:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s1.mp3">여기는 편해요</a> = Here is
        comfortable (it is comfortable here)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s2.mp3">라면은 매워요</a> = Ramen is
        spicy
      </p>
      <p>Those are simple sentences without 더. By adding 더 you can indicate that the particular subjects are “more
        comfortable” or “spicier” than something else. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s3.mp3">여기는 더 편해요</a> = Here is
        more comfortable (it is more comfortable here)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s4.mp3">라면은 더 매워요</a> = Ramen is
        spicier
      </p>
      <p>At this point we haven’t specifically indicated what the subjects are being compared to, but we will get to
        that later in the lesson. For now, let’s just focus on the use of 더. Below are many more examples:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s5.mp3">도심은 더 멀어요</a> = Downtown
        is further<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s6.mp3">이 방은 더 좁아요</a> = This room
        is smaller (narrower)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s7.mp3">추억은 더 중요해요</a> = Memories
        are more important<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s8.mp3">한식은 더 맛있어요</a> = Korean
        food is more delicious<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s9.mp3">저는 더 특별한 것을 사고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to buy something more special<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s10.mp3">저는 더 넓은 집에서 살고 싶어요</a> = I
        want to live in a bigger (wider) house
      </p>
      <p>In all of the examples above, 더 is used with adjectives. It can also be used with verbs to indicate that an
        action will happen “more.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s11.mp3">저는 밥을 더 먹을 거예요</a> = I
        will eat more<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s12.mp3">저는 더 공부할 거예요</a> = I will
        study more<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s13.mp3">저는 더 기다릴 거예요</a> = I will
        wait more (longer)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s14.mp3">그 회사는 월급을 더 줘요</a> = That
        company gives more of a paycheque<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s15.mp3">우리는 돈을 더 모을 거예요</a> = We
        will collect more money<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s16.mp3">저는 손을 더 씻을 거예요</a> = I
        will wash my hands more
      </p>
      <p>In sentences where 더 is used with verbs, it is common to place an adverb after 더 to indicate the degree in
        which the action occurs. When used like this, it’s not that the action happens more – but rather that the verb
        happens more in a way of the adverb. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s17.mp3">저는 더 열심히 공부할 거예요</a> = I
        will study harder<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s18.mp3">저는 밥을 더 건강하게 먹을 거예요</a> =
        I will eat healthier<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s19.mp3">그 학생들은 더 시끄럽게 이야기했어요</a> =
        Those students talked louder
      </p>
      <p>It is also common to use 조금 before 더 to indicate that something occurs “a little bit more.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s20.mp3">이 방은 조금 더 좁아요</a> = This
        room is a little bit smaller<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s21.mp3">저는 조금 더 기다릴 거예요</a> = I
        will wait a little bit more<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s22.mp3">저는 조금 더 열심히 공부할 거예요</a> =
        I will study a little bit harder
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>You can also add 더 to sentences with counters in them. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s23.mp3">나는 펜 두 개가 있어</a> = I have
        two pens<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-5.mp3">나는 펜 두 개가 더 있어</a> = I have
        two more pens
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s25.mp3">사람 두 명이 올 거예요</a> = Two
        people will come<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s26.mp3">사람 두 명이 더 올 거예요</a><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4-Two-more-people-will-come.m4a"> </a>= Two
        more people will come
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s27.mp3">저의 여동생은 지난 주에 책을 두 권
          읽었어요</a> = My sister read two books last week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s28.mp3">저의 여동생은 지난 주에 책을 두 권 더
          읽었어요</a> = My sister read two more books last week
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s29.mp3">나는 어제 학교에 두 번 갔어</a> = I
        went to school two times (twice) yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-6.mp3">나는 어제 학교에 두 번 더 갔어</a> = I
        went to school two more times yesterday
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>It is common to use the word 좋다 with 더 to indicate that something is “more good.” Of course, we don’t say “more
        good” in English. Instead, we say “better.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s31.mp3">도심이 더 좋아요</a> = Downtown
        is better<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s32.mp3">그 자세가 더 좋아요</a> = That
        position/posture is better<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s33.mp3">그 학생의 태도가 더 좋아요</a> = That
        student’s attitude is better
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>It is also common to use the word 많다 with 더 to indicate simply that there <em>is</em> more of something. For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s34.mp3">저는 돈이 더 많아요</a> = I have
        more money<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s35.mp3">여기는 별이 더 많아요</a> = There
        are more stars here
      </p>
      <p>So far, you have seen how 더 can be used in simple sentences without any specifically identified comparison. It
        is also possible to indicate what the situation is being compared to. I will discuss this in the next section.
      </p>
      <h3><a name="compa3"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Comparatives – </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">보다</span></p>
      <p>As you learned in the previous section, you can use 더 in sentences when not making any specific comparison. 더
        is often used in sentences when a specific comparison is being made. In English, comparing is really hard and
        confusing. Look at these examples:</p>
      <p>It is <u>hotter</u> than yesterday<br />
        It is <u>more</u> beautiful than yesterday<br />
        It is smell<u>ier</u> than yesterday</p>
      <p>In English, depending on the word that you are using to compare, the conjugation is different. I can’t imagine
        how annoying this would be for an English learner. Luckily, comparatives in Korean are much simpler (or is it
        more simple?).</p>
      <p>In Korean, you can make a specific comparison by attaching the particle ~보다 to the thing that is being compared
        to. I feel like it is most logical to present sentences using ~보다 in the same order that I presented the
        sentences using 더. So here we go:</p>
      <p>You can use ~보다 to make a specific comparison with adjectives:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s36.mp3">나는 더 잘생겼어</a> = I am more
        handsome<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-10.mp3">나는 아버지보다 더 잘생겼어</a> = I am
        more handsome than my father
      </p>
      <p><em>Notice here the example “</em>잘생기다<em>” (handsome) is conjugated into the past tense. When conjugating
        </em>잘생기다<em> and </em>못생기다<em> it is always more natural to use the past tense conjugation.</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-1.mp3">선생님들은 더 똑똑해요</a> =

        Memories are more important than money
      </p>
      <p><em>You don’t really need </em>더<em> in these types of sentences. The use of ~</em>보다<em> in these types of
          sentences would also carry this meaning. However, there is no harm in including it. </em></p>
      <p>You can use ~보다 to make a specific comparison with verbs:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-5.mp3">나는 밥을 더 먹었어</a> = I ate

        ate more than yesterday

        will study more than last year
      </p>
      <p>You can use adverbs in these sentences to indicate that they occur more as a function of the adverb:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s53.mp3">저는 친구들보다 더 열심히 공부할
          거예요</a> = I will study harder than my friends<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s54.mp3">저는 작년보다 더 열심히 공부할 거예요</a>
        = I will study harder than last year
      </p>
      <p>You can compare things in sentences with counters as well. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s55.mp3">나는 친구보다 펜이 두 개 더 있어</a> =
        I have two more pens than my friend<br />

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>The words 좋다 and 많다 are often used with ~보다 as well. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s58.mp3">저는 옛날보다 돈이 더 많아요</a> = I
        have more money than a long time ago<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s59.mp3">저는 저의 아버지보다 돈이 더 많아요</a> =
        I have more money than my father<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s61.mp3">그 학생의 태도가 지난 주보다 더 좋아요</a>
        = That student’s attitude is better than last week
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>Another way you can create the meaning of “better” is by using the adjective 낫다. 낫다 is very much like 좋다, but
        it is more naturally used when a specified comparison is being made. Therefore, it is common to see 낫다 used in
        sentences with ~보다. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s60.mp3">그 학생의 태도가 지난 주보다 나아요</a>
        = That student’s attitude is better than last week<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s62.mp3">라면보다 밥이 더 나아요</a> = Rice
        is better than Ramen<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s63.mp3">한식보다 양식이 더 나아요</a> =
        Western food is better than Korean food
      </p>
      <p>낫다 is also very commonly used when you are talking about getting better after being sick. You can say things
        like this:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-28.mp3">병은 나았어</a> = I’m better
        (literally – the sickness/disease is better)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-29.mp3">감기는 나았어</a> = My cold is
        better
      </p>
      <p>Although ~보다 is not used in the sentences above, by context the listener assumed that the speaker is referring
        to the time where he/she had a cold.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
      <p>Two words that ~보다 is commonly attached to are 평소 and 생각. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s66.mp3">저는 요즘에 평소보다 더 바빠요</a> =
        These days, I am busier than usual<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-25.mp3">나는 평소보다 더 공부하고 있어</a> = I
        am studying more than usual<br />

        Downtown is further than I thought<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s70.mp3">별이 생각보다 더 많아요</a> = There

      </p>

      <h3><a name="comp32"></a></h3>
      <p><u>덜</u><u> – Less</u></p>
      <p>The word “덜” can be used to have the opposite meaning of 더. That is, it can be used to mean “less.” For
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-30.mp3">나는 남동생보다 덜 잘생겼어</a> = I’m
        less handsome than my brother<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-31.mp3">한국에서 대학교는 고등학교보다 덜
          어려워요</a> = In Korea, University is not as hard as high school
      </p>
      <p>These sentences are correct, and would be perfectly understood, but it is usually more natural and common to
        create the opposite sentence and use 더 instead. For example, I would much rather say the following sentences
        than the two sentences above:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s74.mp3">남동생이 나보다 더 잘생겼어</a> = My
        brother is more handsome than me<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19s75.mp3">한국에서 고등학교는 대학교보다 더
          어려워요</a> = In Korea, high school is harder than university
      </p>
      <p>One more quick thing – it is kind of funny/cute slang to pronounce 덜 as 들. I suggest you try it out sometime.
        Korean people often get a kick out of foreign people speaking in slang-like language. They usually can’t get
        over the fact that we know Korean, let alone the fact that we know a bit of slang.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Superlatives – </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">가장/제일<br />
        </span></p>
      <p align="left">Superlatives, just like comparatives are so much easier in Korean than they are in English. In
        English, depending on the word you are using, you have to conjugate it differently:</p>
      <p align="left">She is the hott<span style="text-decoration: underline;">est</span> girl<br />
        She is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> beautiful girl<br />
        She is the smell<span style="text-decoration: underline;">iest</span> girl</p>
      <p align="left">In Korean, instead of mucking (I said “mucking&#8221;) around with different forms like in
        English, all you need to do is add one word: 가장</p>
      <p align="left">예쁘다 = pretty<br />
        가장 예쁘다 = Prettiest</p>
      <p align="left">아름답다 = beautiful<br />
        가장 아름답다 = Most beautiful</p>
      <p align="left">A synonym of “가장” is “제일,” which is often used in speech.<br />
        You can then put these into sentences just like you would normal adjectives:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-32.mp3">저의 여자 친구는
          한국에서 가장 예쁜 여자예요</a> = My girlfriend is the prettiest girl in Korea<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-33.mp3">가족은 가장 중요해요</a> = Family
        is the most important
      </p>
      <p align="left">You can’t really use 가장 with verbs unless there is also an adverb included within the sentence.
        For example, you can’t say this:</p>
      <p align="left">나는 가장 달려 = I run… most?&#8230; doesn’t make sense</p>
      <p align="left">In these cases, you need to add an adverb to the sentence:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-34.mp3">나는 가장 빨리
          달려</a> = I run the fastest<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-8.mp3">우리가 집에 제일 늦게 도착했어요</a> =
        We arrived home the latest (we were the latest people to arrive at home)
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, you can add 가장 to 좋아하다 (to like) without an adverb to indicate that you ‘like something
        the most.’ (This is also how you say “my favorite” in Korean).</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-36.mp3">나는 그 여자를 가장
          좋아해</a> = I like that girl most (that girl is my favorite)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson19-37.mp3">나는 수학을 가장 좋아해</a> = I like
        math most (math is my favorite)
      </p>
      <p><em>Note here that in most real situations it is probably more natural [in English and in Korean] to say
          something like:</em></p>
      <p><em>I am the fastest runner &#8211; instead of – I run the fastest</em><br />
        <em> Math is my favorite subject – instead of – Math is my favorite</em>
      </p>
      <p><em>To this point, you haven’t learned how to add this extra dimension to your sentences with verbs. This
          concept is introduced in <a title="Lesson 26: ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lesson
            26</a>. That being said, it is essentially the same as making this change to adjectives:<br />
          가족은 가장 중요해요 = Family is the most important<br />
        </em><em>가족이 가장 중요한 것이에요 = Family is the most important thing</em></p>
      <p>In order to express a negative superlative, of course, you can use a word that has a negative meaning, for
        example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-9.mp3">저는 사과를 가장 싫어해요</a> = I
        dislike apples the most<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-10.mp3">저는 사과를 제일 싫어해요</a> = I
        dislike apples the most
      </p>
      <p>You could technically add ~지 않다 or ~안 to the sentence to make it a negative superlative sentence. For example:
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-11.mp3">그 여자는 우리 반에서 가장 예쁘지 않은
          여자예요</a> = That girl is the least pretty in our class<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-12.mp3">그 여자는 우리 반에서 제일 예쁘지 않은
          여자예요</a> = That girl is the least pretty in our class
      </p>
      <p>수학은 가장 쉽지 않아요 = Math is the least easy<br />
        수학은 제일 쉽지 않아요 = Math is the least easy</p>
      <p>However, those sentences would sound much more natural (in English and Korean) if you just used a word with the
        opposite meaning. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-13.mp3">그 여자는 우리 반에서 제일 못생긴
          여자예요</a> = That girl is the ugliest in our class<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-19-14.mp3">수학은 제일 어려워요</a> = Math is
        the hardest
      </p>
      <p>In most of these superlative sentences, it would usually sound much more natural to add “Of all X”. For
        example:</p>
      <p>Of all subjects at school, math is the most difficult<br />
        Of all fruit, I dislike apples the most</p>
      <p>The grammatical principle needed to add this extra level of complexity to your sentences is introduced in <a
          title="Lesson 33: ~중 (하는 중), (~중에)"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-33/">Lesson
          33</a>.</p>
      <p>Two adverbs that 가장/제일 are often used with are 잘 and 못, which will be talked about in the next lesson.</p>
