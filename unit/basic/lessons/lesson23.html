    <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to use colors in Korean by applying the ㅎ irregular. In addition, you will
      learn about the words 이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 and how the ㅎ irregular can be applied to those words. Let’s get started.
    </p>

        style="text-decoration: underline;">ㅎ</span></p>
    <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Korean Colors</span></p>
    <p>You learned all about the Korean irregulars in <a title="Lesson 7: Korean Irregulars"
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-7/">Lesson 7</a>. On top of all of
      those irregulars, there is one more that you should be aware of.<br />
      The reason I didn’t include this irregular in <a title="Lesson 7: Korean Irregulars"
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-7/">Lesson 7</a> is because it is
      an <em>irregular</em> irregular. Usually, if the last consonant of a word stem ends in ㅎ, the word is not
      conjugated in any special way. For example:</p>
    <p>좋다 = 좋아<br />
      많다 = 많아</p>
    <p>However, a lot of colors in Korean end with the final syllable ㅎ (see the vocabulary list for a good list of
      these). When conjugating these words (which are adjectives) to allow them to describe an upcoming noun, we can add
      ~ㄴ/은, just like it is done with other adjectives. However, in some words (mostly colors) the ㅎ gets dropped and ㄴ
      gets added directly to the word stem. For example:</p>

    <p>You can use those color words to describe objects in sentences where appropriate. For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-1.mp3">저 노란 집이 예뻐요</a> = That
      yellow house is pretty<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-2.mp3">빨간 사과는 가장 맛있어요</a><span
        style="line-height: 1.5;"> = Red apples are the most delicious<br />
      </span><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-3.mp3">그녀는 빨간 셔츠를 입고
        있다</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> = She is wearing a red shirt<br />
      </span><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-4.mp3">나는 하얀 차를 사고
        싶어</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> = I want to buy a white car<br />
      </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-2.mp3">저는 보통 까만 양복을 입어요</a> = I
        usually wear</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">black</span><span
        style="line-height: 1.5;"> suits<br />
      </span><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-3.mp3"><span
          style="line-height: 1.5;">파란</span> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">불이</span> <span
          style="line-height: 1.5;">제일</span> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">뜨거워요</span></a><span
        style="line-height: 1.5;"> = The blue flame is the hottest</span>
    </p>
    <p>If you want to use these words as nouns (as in, “the color white” or “the color red”), you can add “색” after the
      adjective form of the color (색 means ‘color’):</p>
    <p>노란색 = the color yellow<br />
      <span style="line-height: 1.5;">빨간색 = the color red<br />
      </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">하얀색 = the color white<br />
      </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">까만색 = the color black<br />
      </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">파란색 = the color blue</span>
    </p>
    <p>Though these words are nouns, they are often placed before another noun to describe it. For example</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-4.mp3">저 노란색 집이 예뻐요</a> = That
      yellow (colored) house is pretty<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-5.mp3">그녀는 빨간색 셔츠를 입고 있어요</a> = She
      is wearing a red (colored) shirt<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-9.mp3">나는 하얀색 차를 사고 싶어</a> = I want
      to buy a white (colored) car<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-6.mp3">저는 보통 까만색 양복을 입어요</a> = I
      usually wear black (colored) suits<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-7.mp3">파란색 불이 제일 뜨거워요</a> = The blue
      (colored) flame is the hottest
    </p>
    <p>Here, each of these “color” nouns is describing an upcoming noun without being an adjective.</p>
    <p>This is a good time to teach you about another usage of the particle “~의”. “~의” can be attached to words that
      commonly describe nouns (like adjectives) but are inherently not adjectives. What I mean by this, is that you will
      often find words that are always (or very commonly) placed before nouns to describe them, but are technically
      classified as adverbs or nouns (and hence, don’t end with “~다” like a typical adjective). It is acceptable to
      attach the particle “~의” to these adjective-like adverbs or nouns when they describe an upcoming noun. The meaning
      is the same when using “~의” or not using it, but in speech it is more common to not use it.</p>
    <p>For example, all of the above could be written as:</p>
    <p>저 노란색의 집이 예뻐요 = That yellow (colored) house is pretty<br />
      그녀는 빨간색의 셔츠를 입고 있다 = She is wearing a red (colored) shirt<br />
      나는 하얀색의 차를 사고 싶어 = I want to buy a white (colored) car<br />
      저는 보통 까만색의 양복을 입어요 = I usually wear black (colored) suits<br />
      파란색의 불이 제일 뜨거워요 = The blue (colored) flame is the hottest</p>
    <p>Although acceptable and understandable, it would be slightly more natural to <em>not </em>use ~의 with these color
      words. Therefore, I didn’t make audio recordings for the sentences above using ~의. In other situations with other
      (non-color) words, you will more commonly see ~의 attached to a noun or adverb being used to describe a noun.</p>
    <p>For example, a common word that ~의 is attached to is “대부분,” which translates to “most.” Just like in English 대부분
      is usually placed immediately before a noun to say “most (noun).” For example:</p>
    <p>대부분 사람들… = Most people…<br />
      대부분 부부들… = Most couples…<br />
      대부분 독자들… = Most readers…</p>
    <p>In each case, it is also possible to attach ~의. For example:</p>
    <p>대부분의 사람들… = Most people…<br />
      대부분의 부부들… = Most couples…<br />
      대부분의 독자들… = Most readers…</p>
    <p>These constructions can now be used in sentences where appropriate. For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-8.mp3">대부분의 사람들은 아침밥을 먹지 않아요</a> =
      Most people don’t eat breakfast (rice breakfast)<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-9.mp3">대부분 사람들은 아침밥을 먹지 않아요</a> =
      Most people don’t eat breakfast (rice breakfast)
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-10.mp3">대부분의 부부들은 같은 침대에서 자요</a> =
      Most couples sleep in the same bed<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-11.mp3">대부분 부부들은 같은 침대에서 자요</a> =
      Most couples sleep in the same bed
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-12.mp3">대부분의 독자들은 그 작품을 안 좋아해요</a>
      = Most readers don’t like that work<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-13.mp3">대부분 독자들은 그 작품을 안 좋아해요</a> =
      Most readers don’t like that work
    </p>
    <p>Using ~의 here is in effect the same reason why we can attach ~의 to counters when placed before a noun (as you
      learned in <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/unit-1-lesson-10/">Lesson 10</a>).
      To jog your memory, in that lesson I said it was acceptable to place a counter before a noun you are counting
      followed by the use of “~의.”</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-18.mp3">나는 네 개의 펜을 샀어</a> = I
      bought four pens<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-19.mp3">나는 두 개의 햄버거를 먹었어</a> = I ate
      two hamburgers<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-10-1.mp3">나는 어제 다섯 명의 친구를 만났어</a> = I
      met five friends yesterday
    </p>
    <p>The number-counter pairs in the above sentences are effectively describing the upcoming noun. Of course, the
      number-counter pairs are not adjectives, so ~의 can be used.</p>
    <p>I dig deeper into the use of “의” and specifically how it relates to “적” (which was introduced in <a
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-16/">Lesson 16</a>) <a href="#dis">later
        in the lesson</a>. I want you to be aware of this usage of ~의 and how it can be attached to adverbs and nouns
      when describing an upcoming noun. However, the main purpose of this lesson is to talk about color words and the ㅎ
      irregular, so I will continue with that now.</p>
    <p>Often, the most common way to describe a color is to use a word that only exists as a noun and does not have an
      adjective form. For example, look at the following:</p>
    <p>초록색 = (the color) green<br />
      연두색 = (the color) light green<br />
      보라색 = (the color) purple<br />
      분홍색 = (the color) pink<br />
      갈색 = (the color) brown<br />
      회색 = (the color) grey</p>
    <p>The above are all color words, but they do not have a respective adjective form (like 빨갛다 and 빨간색). In order to
      use these words to describe the color of something, they can be placed immediately before a noun (naturally)
      without ~의 and (slightly unnaturally) with 의 just as described earlier. For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-14.mp3">저는 초록색(의) 펜으로 쓰고 싶어요</a> =
      I want to write this with a green pen<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-15.mp3">연두색(의) 바지를 샀어요</a> = I
      bought green pants<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-16.mp3">대부분(의) 여자들은 분홍색(의) 가방을
        골랐어요</a> = Most girls chose the pink bag<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-17.mp3">남자 친구가 보라색(의) 꽃 한 송이를
        샀어요</a> = My boyfriend bought one purple flower
    </p>
    <p>When adding “~아/어” (or any of its derivatives) to color words where the stem ends in ‘ㅎ,’ an irregular
      conjugation applies. For now, the only situation you know where you would add ~아/어 (or a derivative like ~았/었) is
      when conjugating using the honorifics introduced in <a
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>. Note that there
      are other times when you would have to add ~아/어 to words, you just haven’t learned about them yet.</p>
    <p>When adding ~아/어 to these words, the ㅎ is dropped and the final vowel changes to either ㅐ or ㅒ. If the final
      vowel is ㅏ or ㅓ, it changes to ㅐ, and if the final vowel is ㅑ, it changes to ㅒ. For example:</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="130">Word</td>

    <p>Here are some of these used in sentences:</p>

    <p>In each case, it would also be acceptable to use the noun form of each of the words above and conjugate the
      sentence with 이다. For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-23.mp3">불이 노란색이에요</a> = The light
      is (the color) yellow<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-24.mp3">얼굴이 왜 빨간색이에요?</a> = Why is
      your face (the color) red<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-25.mp3">유럽 사람의 피부는 하얀색이에요</a> =
      European people’s skin is (the color white)<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-26.mp3">그 여자의 머리가 까만색이에요</a> = That
      girl’s hair is (the color) black<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-27.mp3">저 남자의 눈이 진짜 파란색이에요</a> =
      That man’s eyes are really (the color) blue
    </p>
    <p><em>A more advanced Korean speaker (or a Korean person) could argue that the two sets of sentences are not
        completely identical. Their meanings and translations could be exactly the same, but they could have a slightly
        different nuance. For example, “</em>얼굴이 왜 빨개요?<em>” would be more about a face being red as a result of it
        blushing, whereas “</em>얼굴이 왜 빨간색이에요?<em>” would be more about a face that is actually red from something like
        paint. This nuance is very subtle and not something you need to worry about as a beginner. Even as an advanced
        learner, I find it very hard to articulate this difference into words. In a way, I find the difference between
        the two similar to “why is your face red?” and “why is your face the color red?” </em></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
    <p>So far, you have seen how ~ㄴ/은 and ~아/어 cause the ㅎ irregulars to change. Since the beginning of this course, you
      have also learned the following additions that could potentially cause a change to a word stem:</p>
    <p>~ㅂ/습니다 (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>)<br />
      ~ㄹ/을 (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/unit-1-lesson-9/">Lesson 9</a>)<br />
      ~니 and ~나 (<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-1-listening-practice/lesson-21/">Lesson 21</a>)</p>
    <p>To this point, you have seen how these additions can cause changes to the irregulars introduced in Lesson 7.
      Because this is your first time learning about the ㅎ irregular, we should quickly discuss the changes that occur
      as a result of adding these to ㅎ irregular words:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding ~ㅂ/습니다 does not cause a change to ㅎ irregular words. ~습니다 is added directly to the stem. For example:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>노랗다 + ~ㅂ/습니다 = 노랗습니다</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding ~ㄹ/을 causes a change to ㅎ irregular words. The ㅎ is removed, and ~ㄹ is added to the stem. For this
        addition, the ㅎ irregular and ㄹ irregular follow the same rule. For example:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>살다 + ~ㄹ/을 = 살<br />
      노랗다 + ~ㄹ/을 = 노랄</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding ~니 causes a change to ㅎ irregular words. The ㅎ is removed, and ~니 is added after the stem. For this
        addition, the ㅎ irregular and ㄹ irregular follow the same rule. For example:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>살다 + ~니 = 사니<br />
      노랗다 + ~니 = 노라니</p>
    <p>The table below shows all of the additions you have learned so far that can cause a change to a word stem. This
      table shows how these additions affect various words, including words that follow the ㅎ irregular. Examples where
      irregulars apply are in bold.</p>

    <p>You will learn more additions in later lessons. In those lessons, you will learn how each addition affects each
      irregular – including the ㅎ irregular.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
    <p>The words 이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 are not colors, but they also follow the ㅎ irregular. I will talk about those in the
      section below.</p>
    <h3><a name="234"></a></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">이렇다</span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">그렇다</span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">저렇다</span></p>
    <p>이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 are all adjectives. Each word is essentially the same – the only difference being the difference
      between 이, 그 and 저. Remember the difference between these?</p>
    <p>이 means “this”</p>
    <p>그 means “that” when you are referring to something in a previous sentence. For example: “I went to Canada last
      week. At <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> time I forgot about my test that I had to
      write.&#8221;</p>
    <p>저 means “that” when something is far from you.</p>
    <p>이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 are very important and common in Korean, so let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>
    <h3><a name="235"></a></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">이렇다</span></p>
    <p>이렇다 means “like this,” but (along with 그렇다 and 저렇다) is rarely used in its dictionary form. It is generally used
      in two ways: as an adjective and as an adverb:</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an Adjective: </span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">이런</span><br />
      By adding ~ㄴ/은 to the stem of 이렇다 we get 이런, which means “this sort of/this kind of/this type of.” For example:
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-35.mp3">이런 일은 위험하다</a> = This type
      of work is dangerous<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-36.mp3">이런 차는 너무 커요</a> = This type
      of car is too big
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an Adverb: </span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">이렇게</span><br />
      By adding ~게 to the stem of 이렇다 we get 이렇게, which means “like this.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-37.mp3">저는 이렇게 하고 싶어요</a> = I want
      to do it like this<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-38.mp3">왜 이렇게 일찍 가요?</a> = Why are
      you going so early (like this)?<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-39.mp3">이 일은 왜 이렇게 어려워요?</a> = Why
      is this so hard (like this)?
    </p>
    <p>You’ll notice that in the last two examples, the words “like this” in English don’t necessarily need to be in the
      sentence. It is hard to fully explain in words, as this is something that you really just pick up after a while
      when learning Korean. When Korean people ask a “why” question, they often stress “<em>why</em>” by using 이렇게.</p>
    <p>*Also notice the usage of “일” in the sentence above. Although the best translation of the word “일” is “work” (in
      noun form), it is very common for Korean people to use “일” to represent some sort of task or thing that somebody
      has to do (regardless of if we would call it “work” in English). I am reluctant to show you the most common
      example of this being used because you haven’t learned the grammar within it yet. Nonetheless, you will often see
      “저는 할 일이 있어요” which translates to “I have something to do.” As of now, you haven’t learned how “할” is being used,
      but try to focus on the usage of “일” in this sentence. The sentence is essentially saying “I have a task that I
      will do.” The sentence above could also be written as “이것은 왜 이렇게 어려워요.”</p>
    <h3><a name="236"></a></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">그렇다</span></p>
    <p>Now that you know about 이렇다, learning about 그렇다 is simple. Like 이렇다, 그렇다 is usually used as an adjective or an
      adverb:</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an Adjective: </span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">그런</span><br />
      By adding ~ㄴ/은 to the stem of 그렇다 we get 그런, which means “that sort of/that kind of/that type of.” For example:
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-40.mp3">저는 그런 사람을 믿지 않아요</a> = I
      don’t trust that type of person/those types of people<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-41.mp3">저는 그런 것을 좋아하지 않아요</a> = I
      don’t like that type of thing<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
      </span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an Adverb: </span><span
        style="text-decoration: underline;">그렇게</span><br />
      By adding ~게 to the stem of 그렇다 we get 그렇게, which means “like that.”</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-42.mp3">저는 그렇게 생각하지 않아요</a> = I
      don’t think like that<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-43.mp3">저는 그렇게 운동하고 싶어요</a> = I want
      to exercise like that
    </p>
    <h3><a name="237"></a></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><u>저렇다</u></p>
    <p>저렇다 can be used the same way as 이렇다 and 그렇다; as 저런 and 저렇게. All you need to do is to keep in mind the differences
      between 이, 그 and 저.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an adjective: 저런</span><br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-44.mp3">저는 저런 여자를 좋아하지 않아요</a> = I
      don’t like that kind of girl<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-28.mp3">저는 저런 차를 사고 싶어요</a> = I want
      to buy that type of car
    </p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As an adverb: 저렇게</span><br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson23-46.mp3">아빠는 왜 저렇게 말하고 있어요?</a> = Why
      is dad talking like that?<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-29.mp3">저 사람이 왜 저렇게 걸어요?</a> = Why
      is that person walking like that?
    </p>
    <p>Just like our color words presented earlier in this lesson, when ~아/어 (or a derivative) is added to 이렇다, 그렇다 or
      저렇다, an irregular conjugation occurs. Let’s look at this next.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><a name="pre"></a></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 As Predicating
        Words</span></p>
    <p>이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 can also be used as the predicating word (i.e. the end) of a sentence. These are usually only
      seen in relatively simple sentences asking or indicating if something is “like this/like that.” For example:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-30.mp3">이 학교도 그렇지 않습니까?</a> = Is
      this school not like that as well?<br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-30.mp3">네, 그렇습니다</a> = Yes, that is
      correct (that is the way it is)
    </p>
    <p>The most common way that you will see any of these words being used, especially for a beginner, is in the
      following form:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-31.mp3">왜 이래?</a><br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-31.mp3"> 왜 그래?</a><br />
      <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-31.mp3"> 왜 저래?</a>
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the sameㅎ irregular applies to the words above. That is, when adding ~아/어 (or one of its
      derivatives), the ㅎ is dropped and the ㅓ changes to ㅐ.</p>
    <p>In each case, the speaker is asking “Why are you like this/that?” This is very common in Korean conversation, as
      it essentially is like saying “what’s wrong?” or “what’s the matter” or “what the **** are you doing?”</p>
    <p>그렇다 specifically is also commonly used by people to express their content/agreement with some sort of statement
      or situation. For example:</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-32.mp3">내일 공원에 같이 가고
        싶어요?</a> = Do you want to go to the park together tomorrow?<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-32.mp3">그래요. 같이 가요</a> =
      Sure (like that is fine). Let’s go together.</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-33.mp3">제가 지금 갈 거예요</a> =
      I’m going to go now<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-33.mp3">그래요!</a> = Sure
      (like that is fine)</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-34.mp3">저는 내일 회사에 못
        와요</a> = Tomorrow, I can’t come to work<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-34.mp3">그래요! 월요일에 봐요!</a>
      = Sure (like that is fine). See you on Monday!</p>
    <p>In this same respect, it is often used as a question to express one’s “disbelief” or “shock.” In reality, the
      speaker isn’t actually “shocked” or “in disbelief” but is merely showing his/her interest in the conversation.
      This would be akin to using the word “Really?!” in English. For example:</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-35.mp3">저는 지난 주에 캐나다에
        있었어요</a> = I was in Canada last week<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-35.mp3">그래요? 어디에 갔어요?</a>
      = Really!? (It&#8217;s like that?) Where did you go?</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-36.mp3">나는 보통 고기를 안
        먹어</a> = I usually don’t eat meat<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-36.mp3">그래? 왜 안 먹어?</a> =
      Really? (It&#8217;s like that?) Why don’t you eat it?</p>
    <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-37.mp3">이 물이 맛이 없어</a> =
      This water doesn’t taste good<br />
      Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lesson23-37.mp3">그래?</a> = Really?
      (It&#8217;s like that?)</p>
    <p>Many other grammatical principles can be added to 이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 but these haven’t been introduced yet.</p>
    <p>Specifically, you will find that many grammatical principles can attach to 그렇다 to have their respective meaning
      combined with the meaning of 그렇다. These will all be introduced in future lessons (where the grammatical principle
      is introduced), but here is a quick taste of what I am referring to. I suggest browsing through this list just to
      get an idea of:</p>
    <p>a) How versatile 그렇다 is<br />
      b) The general meaning of 그렇다<br />
      c) How this meaning can be applied to many, many other grammatical principles.</p>
    <p>This list is by no means exhaustive, but rather a small taste of some of the concepts that you will be learning
      in the next 100 lessons or so.</p>

    <p>At this point, I hope you can understand how 이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다 can be used, and their general meanings. In
      addition, I hope you can understand how color words can be used in sentences. Just below, I will continue the
      discussion of the use of ~의 and how it is used on words where ~적 is commonly attached.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr />

    <h3><a name="dis"></a></h3>
    <p>I have had some people ask me about the difference between using “의” on a word to describe a noun (like 흰색의 차)
      and using “적” on a word to describe a noun. The grammar below is a little bit advanced, but this is the lesson
      that it belongs in (as I am already discussing the purpose of “~의” attached to nouns or adverbs to describe an
      upcoming noun). It might be good to glimpse over this, and then come back to it later when you have a better
      understanding of Korean grammar.</p>
    <p>As you will recall from <a title="Lesson 16: Noun + ~적, ~적으로, ~적이다, ~스럽다"
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-16/">Lesson 16</a>, “적” can be added to
      words to change them into a type of adjective as well. As I mentioned in Lesson 16, the addition of “적” to a noun
      causes the word to change a little bit. It’s hard to say exactly how the word changes, because it is a little bit
      different for every word. The examples that are given in the lesson are:</p>
    <p>경제 = economy/economics<br />
      경제적 = economical</p>
    <p>역사 = history<br />
      역사적 = historical</p>
    <p>과학 = science<br />
      과학적 = scientific</p>
    <p>충동 = impulse/shock<br />
      충동적 = impulsive</p>
    <p>문화 = culture<br />
      문화적 = cultural</p>
    <p>개인 = individual/personal<br />
      개인적 = individual</p>
    <p>Some other examples that you might want to jot down, but not memorize at this point because they are quite
      advanced:</p>
    <p>열정 = passion<br />
      열정적 = passionate</p>
    <p>체계 = system<br />
      체계적 = systematic</p>
    <p>획일 = standardization<br />
      획일적 = standardized</p>
    <p>세계 = world<br />
      세계적 = global</p>
    <p>Before I start, I want to first mention that the “의” that we are talking about here is not the possessive
      particle that is discussed in <a title="Lesson 3: Korean Verbs/Adjectives"
        href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-3/">Lesson 3</a>. Rather, it is a
      particle that is added to a word that is inherently not an adjective, but allows it to describe an upcoming noun
      (like an adjective).</p>
    <p>Most of the time, adding “적” literally changes the translation of the word. As you can see in the list above, the
      word changes when “적” is added. For example, from “passion” to “passionate”. However, when just “의” is added to
      the word, the translation would not change – and using “noun+의” only makes sense if that word (the original word)
      can actually act as an adjective (without being an adjective) to begin with.</p>
    <p>The easiest examples to start with are ones that work with “적” but not with “의”. For example:</p>
    <p>열정 means “passion.” I can say things like:<br />
      과학에 대한 학생의 열정은 놀라워요 = The student’s passion for science is surprising</p>
    <p>“적” can be added to mean “passionate”. For example:<br />
      그는 열정적인 사람이다 = He is a passionate man</p>
    <p>However, simply adding “의” to the noun (열정) does not change it from “passion” to “passionate”. The meaning still
      stays as “passion”. Using this in a sentence would yield:<br />
      그는 열정의 사람이다 = He is a passion man – which doesn’t make sense</p>
    <p>In the same way “과학” means “science”<br />
      과학적 means “scientific”<br />
      과학의 still means “science”</p>
    <p>I can use “과학적” to describe a noun that would be natural being described by “scientific”. For example:</p>
    <p>과학적인 증거 = scientific proof</p>
    <p>However, “과학의 증거” literally translates to “science proof” which wouldn’t sound right.</p>
    <p>Now, just like everything in life, there are some exceptions. Specifically, the word “개인” (without the use of “적”
      or “의” actually means personal. Therefore, just like how the word “대부분(의)” (most) isn’t actually an adjective but
      feels like an adjective, “개인의” can be placed before a noun to describe it.<br />
      “개인적” also works, as it also means “personal.”</p>
    <p>My advice is to learn words with “적” as separate words. Don’t try to think of words with “적” as a noun followed
      by a grammatical principle, but try to think of them as their own words with their own translation. From what I
      can see – there are some words where the “-적” version of the word is the same as the non-적 version of the word. In
      these cases, it appears that both “의” and “적” can be used.</p>
