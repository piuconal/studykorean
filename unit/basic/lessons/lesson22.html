      <div id="target-id6783d311cbf91" class="collapseomatic_content ">
        <p>Common Usages:<br />
          계란찜 = steamed egg<br />
          계란 후라이 = fried eggs</p>
        <p>계란 한 판 = a carton of eggs (this is also sometimes used as an idiom to say that somebody is thirty years old
          because there are typically 30 eggs in a carton of eggs in Korea)</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
          저는 <strong>계란</strong> 두 개를 그릇에 넣었어요 = I put two <strong>eggs</strong> into the bowl

        <p>Notes: Incredibly common word that is used in very important situations. 자리 is some area of space, but not
          really 3-dimensional space. It is more space on the ground or something similar to that. For example, if
          somebody is standing where you are standing, you could say “get out of my place/my spot!” In that case, you
          can use 자리. In practice, it is very commonly used to have the meaning “seat”:</p>

          this sounds weird in English, but Korean people will always use this format when asking if somebody had a good

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span></p>
      <p>In the previous lesson, you learned about how to make question sentences in Korean. In this lesson, you will
        build on what you learned in <a title="Lesson 21: Asking Questions in Korean: Why, When, Where, Who"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">Lesson
          21</a> by learning more ways to ask questions in Korean. Specifically, you will learn how to ask questions
        using the following words: how, what, which and how many.</p>
      <h3><a name="221"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">어떻게</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p align="left">어떻게 is the easiest of the words that you will learn today. The word 어떻게 is actually 어떻다 (a word
        you don’t know yet) turned into an adverb by adding ~게 to the stem (어떻 + 게). Though 어떻다 and 어떻게 are technically
        the same word, don’t think of them that way. Just remember that 어떻게 means “how.” You can use 어떻게 to ask how
        somebody does a <em>verb</em>, but it can not be placed before an adjective or adverb in Korean to mean “how
        (adjective/adverb).” For example:</p>
      <p align="left">“Learn” is a verb, so you can use 어떻게 in the following sentence:<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          How</span> did you learn?</p>
      <p align="left">“Beautiful” is an adjective. “Often” is an adverb. Which means you can<em> not </em>use 어떻게 in the
        following sentences:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          How</span> beautiful is your girlfriend?<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
          How</span> often do you go to school?</p>
      <p>You will learn another word (얼마나) later in this lesson to use in those sentences.</p>
      <p>어떻게 is an adverb, so you can place it in sentences very freely. You can use it to ask questions in the past,
        present or future tense. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-1.mp3">그것을 어떻게 해요?</a> = How do
        you do that?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-2.mp3">한국어를 어떻게 배웠어요?</a> = How
        did you learn Korean?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-1.mp3">그 자리를 어떻게 찾았어요?</a> = How
        did you find that seat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-2.mp3">그 파일을 어떻게 보낼 거예요?</a> =
        How are you going to send that file?
      </p>
      <p>One thing that is different between English and Korean is when you ask “<em>what</em> do you think about…” If
        you want to say that in Korean, you have to use the equivalent of “how do you think about…”:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-5.mp3">그 여자에 대해 어떻게
          생각해요?</a> = What do you think about that girl?</p>
      <p align="left">That’s pretty much all you need to know with regards to ‘어떻게,’ but there is still more that you
        should know about the word 어떻다.</p>
      <h3><a name="223"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어때</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">?</span><br />
        The word 어떻다 is rarely used as 어떻다 in sentences. Actually, if you asked Korean people if they thought that ‘어떻다’
        and 어떻게’ are the same word, they would probably say that the two are completely different words.</p>
      <p>In addition to 어떻게, there is another way that you can use 어떻다 in sentences. Through conjugation, 어떻다 can change
        to ‘어때.” I’ll show you how 어떻다 changes to 어때, but you really don’t need to worry about how it is changed (there
        are only a few other words in Korean that can take on a similar transformation).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>어떻다 is an adjective</li>
        <li>~아/어하다 can be added to <em>some </em>adjectives (You already know about 좋다 + ~아/어하다 = 좋아하다)</li>
        <li>The addition of ~아/어하다 causes the ㅎ to drop (you will learn more about this in the <a
            title="Lesson 23: ㅎ Irregular: Korean Colors, 이렇다, 그렇다 and 저렇다"
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-23/">next lesson</a>)</li>
        <li>어떠하다 can conjugate to 어떠해</li>
        <li>Say 어떠해 fast enough and it comes out as “어때”</li>
      </ol>
      <p align="left">어때 is used to say “how is/was the…?” or “what do/did you think about…?” It is used when you want
        to ask somebody’s opinion/evaluation of something. It sounds more natural in Korean for the thing you are asking
        about with “어때” to not have a particle. For example:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-6.mp3">남자 친구 어때?</a>
        = How is your boyfriend? (is he good/bad/handsome/etc..?)</p>
      <p align="left">It is also very commonly used in the present tense to say “how about&#8230; ?/what do you think
        of&#8230;?&#8221; For example:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-7.mp3">점심 어때?</a> =
        How about lunch? / What do you think about lunch?</p>
      <p align="left">Think of this example. You and I are searching through a bunch of pictures, trying to find the
        best one for my profile picture on Facebook. I find one that I like, but I want to ask you “what do you think
        about this picture/how about this picture?” In that case, I can say:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-3.mp3">이 사진(이)
          어때?</a> = How about this picture?</p>
      <p align="left">In fact, 어때 is probably <em>the </em>most commonly miss-translated word by Korean speakers
        learning English. If you ask a Korean person what ‘어때’ means, they will all say it means “how about.” Sometimes,
        this is true, but 어때 can only be used as “how about” in a limited number of cases. In the example I just gave
        about choosing a good picture, 어때 can be translated to “how about.” But what about in example with the
        boyfriend?:</p>
      <p align="left">How about your boyfriend?</p>
      <p align="left">Sounds weird, and most English-speaking people probably couldn’t even understand the meaning of
        this sentence.</p>
      <p align="left">Try it sometime. If you have a Korean friend (one that can’t speak 100% perfect English), ask him
        how to say “한국 어때?” in English. I guarantee he will say “How about Korea?” But really, this should be translated
        to “what do you think about Korea?/How is Korea?”</p>
      <p align="left">~요 can be added to 어때 to make it more formal. Also, 어때 can be put into the past-tense to ask about
        something in the past. But note that even if you are asking about the past, it is not 100% necessary to use 어때
        in the past tense:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-9.mp3">시험 어땠어요?</a>
        = How was the exam?/What did you think about the exam? (was it hard/easy?)<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s1.mp3">점심 어땠어요?</a> = How was
        the lunch?/What did you think about the lunch? (was it delicious?)
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="224"></a></h3>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">뭐</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">무엇</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">무슨</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p align="left">Now that you’ve learned all the easy ways to ask questions, let&#8217;s work on the hard ways.
        Figuring out how to ask “what” in Korean is probably the hardest thing you will come across (grammatically) for
        a while. Essentially, there are three ways to say “what:”</p>
      <p>뭐 – which is a pronoun<br />
        무엇 – which is a pronoun<br />
        무슨 – which is a word that can be placed before nouns to describe them</p>
      <p>Let me explain how each one is used.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="225"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">뭐</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> and </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">무엇</span></p>
      <p>These two essentially have the same meaning and function. Let me introduce 뭐 first.</p>
      <p>뭐 can be used similar to 언제, 어디 and 누구. That is, to represent an unknown thing in a sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>밥을 먹었어 = I ate rice<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Lesson-25-1.mp3">뭐 먹었어요?</a> = What did you
        eat?
      </p>
      <p>계란을 샀어요 = I bought eggs<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-4.mp3">뭐 샀어요?</a> = What did you
        buy?
      </p>
      <p>Like 누구 (as you learned in the <a title="Lesson 21: Asking Questions in Korean: Why, When, Where, Who"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">previous
          lesson</a>), “뭐” and “what” act as a pronouns in their respective sentences. More examples:</p>
      <p>파일을 첨부했어요 = I attached the file<br />
        뭐 첨부했어요? = What did you attach?</p>
      <p>치마를 입었어요 = I put on a skirt<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-6.mp3">뭐 입었어요?</a> = What did you
        put on/wear?
      </p>
      <p>Particles are not usually attached to 뭐 when asking a question like this. For example, these would be
        unnatural:</p>
      <p>뭐를 먹었어요?<br />
        뭐를 첨부했어요?<br />
        뭐를 입었어요?</p>
      <p>One of the times it is possible to attach a particle to 뭐 is when asking somebody what they are referring to in
        a previous sentence where a noun was omitted. For example, if you look at this dialogue:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-7.mp3">저는 많이 먹었어요</a>
        = I ate a lot<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-7.mp3">뭐를?</a> = what?
        (you ate a lot of what?)</p>
      <p>Here, the first person didn’t specifically indicate what he/she ate. The second person is asking for
        clarification of what was eaten, and can use “뭐를.” Here, “뭐” essentially acts as the noun that was omitted in
        the previous sentence.</p>
      <p>무엇 is very similar to 뭐. However, it is more common to attach ~을 to 무엇 than with 뭐. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-15.mp3">점심을 먹었어?</a> = Did you
        eat lunch?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-16.mp3">무엇을 먹었어?</a> = What did
        you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-8.mp3">무엇을 입었어요?</a> = What did
        you put on/wear?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-9.mp3">무엇을 샀어요?</a> = What did
        you buy?
      </p>
      <p>When used before 이다 to ask what something “is,” it is more common to use 뭐 than to use 무엇. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-10.mp3">이것이 뭐야?</a> = What is
        this?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-11.mp3">이름이 뭐예요?</a> = What is
        your name?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-12.mp3">점심이 뭐야?</a> = What is
        (for) lunch?
      </p>
      <p>Instead of:<br />
        이것이 무엇이야?<br />
        이름이 무엇이야?<br />
        점심이 무엇이야?</p>
      <h3><a name="227"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">무슨</span></p>
      <p>무슨 also translates to “what” but it is instead placed before nouns to describe them.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p>그 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see that movie?<br />
        무서운 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see a scary movie?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-22.mp3">무슨 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = What
        movie do you want to see?
      </p>
      <p>The dictionary form of 무슨 <em>is</em> 무슨. Although it looks like an adjective with ~ㄴ/은 attached to it, the
        word itself is 무슨, and thus, is not actually an adjective. However, it looks and feels like an adjective because
        of how it is used in sentences.</p>
      <p>무슨 is used when the speaker doesn’t know what an object is, and is asking about what it may be. The most common
        situations you will see 무슨 used are the following:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-13.mp3">그것이 무슨 냄새야?</a> = What
        is that smell?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-14.mp3">무슨 생각(을) 해?</a> = What
        are you thinking?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-15.mp3">그것이 무슨 소리야?</a> = What is
        that sound?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-16.mp3">무슨 말이야?</a> = What do you
        mean?<br />
        <em>(The last two examples are often used to ask “what do you mean” or “I can’t understand what you are trying
          to say”)</em>
      </p>
      <p>One way I like to think of 무슨 and how it can be distinguished from 어떤 and 어느 (which you will learn next in the
        lesson), is that 무슨 is used when the speaker is asking a question and has no idea what the answer will be. The
        answer could be almost an unlimited choice of options. For example, if I ask:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-17.mp3">무슨 냄새야?</a> = What is
        that smell?</p>
      <p>I might use that if I just walk into a room and smell something for the first time. Because of this, I would
        not know the source of the smell and would have no idea what the answer to my question might be. The answer
        could be anywhere from “my fart” to “the toaster.”</p>
      <p>Likewise, if I ask:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-14.mp3">무슨 생각(을) 해?</a> = What
        are you thinking?</p>
      <p>I might be looking at somebody and seeing them staring into space. In this case, I would not be able to even
        guess what that person is thinking, so I have no idea what the answer to my question might be. The answer could
        be anywhere from “my future” to “eating pizza.”</p>
      <p>Sounds simple enough, right? Let’s talk about other words that are often confused with 무슨.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="228"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Which (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">어떤</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">/</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">어느</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span></p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어떤</span></p>
      <p>어떤 is another one of these words that, although not an adjective, we can place before a noun to describe it.
        For example:</p>
      <p>그 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see that movie?<br />
        무서운 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see a scary movie?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-22.mp3">무슨 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = What
        movie do you want to see?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-29.mp3">어떤 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = Which
        movie do you want to see?
      </p>
      <p>Or</p>
      <p>그 차를 사고 싶어요? = Do you want to buy that car?<br />
        비싼 차를 사고 싶어요? = Do you want to buy an expensive car?<br />
        무슨 차를 사고 싶어요? = What car do you want to buy?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-19.mp3">어떤 차를 사고 싶어요?</a> = Which
        car do you want to buy?
      </p>
      <p>The first question every learner has when learning about 어떤 is how it can be differentiated from 무슨. 어떤 usually
        translates to “which” and 무슨 usually translates to “what.” Their meanings are very similar and their respective
        English translations don’t really give any hints as to what the differences between the two are.</p>
      <p>The difference is subtle, and at this point you don’t really need to fully understand how they are different.
        The difference is even hard for Korean people to understand, and using one of them in place of the other usually
        creates a sentence with essentially the exact same meaning. That being said, let me give you a brief
        introduction of how they are different.</p>
      <p>In the case of asking questions, 어떤 is used for two main reasons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To choose from a selection of options</span><br />
          For example, in: “어떤 차를 사고 싶어요?” Maybe you are selling cars and giving a person a selection of cars to choose
          from. Here, although you technically don’t know the answer to the question, you can assume that it will be
          from a limited number of choices given.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To ask about the type of properties or characteristics related to
            a person/object<br />
          </span>For example, in: “어떤 차를 사고 싶어요?” Maybe you are asking your friend about the type of car he wants to buy
          based on the characteristics of it. Here, you could be asking if he wants to buy a van, an SUV, a truck, etc…
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>By looking at those two main usages, you can see how 어떤 should not be used to replace 무슨 in most situations.
        For example, in the examples earlier with 무슨, I showed you this sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-17.mp3">무슨 냄새야?</a> = What is
        that smell?</p>
      <p>Here, “<a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-17.mp3">무슨 냄새야?</a>”
        would be used when the person doesn’t know the source of the smell, and has no idea what the smell could be.
        Like I said earlier, the answer to the question would likely indicate the source of the smell and could
        literally be anything from “farts” to “the toaster.”</p>
      <p>However saying “어떤 냄새야?” in most situations would be ridiculous. It could only really be used if you are asking
        a person to tell you about the characteristics of a smell they are smelling. For example, imagine if you had a
        bouquet of flowers and put the flowers to your friend’s nose. In this case, you want your friend to describe the
        characteristics of the smell – “Is it a nice smell? A fresh smell? A rosy smell?” The answer to this question
        would likely be describing (the characteristics) of the smell.</p>
      <p>Despite this distinction, there are many situations where 어떤 and 무슨 could basically be used interchangeably.
        For example, ask a Korean person if they can describe the differences between the two sentences:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-22.mp3">무슨 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = What
        movie do you want to see?<br />
        <em>(In theory, the speaker would have no idea what the answer to the question would be)</em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-29.mp3">어떤 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> =
        Which movie do you want to see?<br />
        <em>(In theory, the speaker would have given the listener a choice to choose from, or would be asking about the
          type of movie the listener wants to see [for example, a comedy, a horror movie, or a love story]).</em>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>Another usage of 어떤 that is completely unrelated to asking questions can be seen in this sentence:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-31.mp3">어떤 남자는 어제 여기에 왔어</a> =
        Some man came here yesterday</p>
      <p>Here, 어떤 is used to show that the speaker knew a man came, but is unsure of specifically who he was. This can
        be applied to other nouns as well when the speaker is aware of some object, but is unsure of what specific
        object is in question. For example</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-20.mp3">저는 어떤 책을 읽고 있었어요</a> = I
        was reading some book<br />
        <em>(the speaker doesn’t know exactly what book he was reading)</em>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-21.mp3">저는 어떤 건물에 들어갔어요</a> = I
        went into some building<br />
        <em>(the speaker doesn’t know exactly what building he went into)</em>
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just when you thought you might actually be understanding this confusion, we have to look at another word with
        a similar meaning.</p>
      <h3><a name="229"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어느</span></p>
      <p>Another way you can ask this type of question is with the word 어느. Like 무슨 and 어떤, 어느 is placed immediately
        before nouns.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for your brain, 어느 translates to “which.” For example:</p>
      <p>그 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see that movie?<br />
        무서운 영화를 보고 싶어요? = Do you want to see a scary movie?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-22.mp3">무슨 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = What
        movie do you want to see?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-29.mp3">어떤 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> = Which
        movie do you want to see?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-22.mp3">어느 영화를 보고 싶어요?</a> =
        Which movie do you want to see?

      <p>In the case of asking questions, 어느 is used in a similar way to the first explanation I gave of 어떤 from above.
        That is, “to choose from a selection of options.” It would not be used to refer to the type of characteristics
        or properties of an object, and it would not be used to refer to something unknown.</p>
      <p>Here, you can see that the usages of 무슨, 어떤 and 어느 overlap on multiple levels. Although this overlap leads to
        confusion, it also allows each word to be used interchangeably in most cases, which makes using them easier than
        you think. In my opinion, it is just as important to realize how <em>not </em>to use each of these words when
        asking a question. Let me brief that for you:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">무슨:</span><br />
        Don’t use this when asking about the type of characteristics or properties of something<br />
        Don’t use this when giving somebody options to choose from</p>
      <p>However,<br />
        Do use this when you can’t expect what the answer will be at all</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어떤:</span><br />
        Don’t use this when asking about something that you can’t expect the answer for</p>
      <p>However,<br />
        Do use this when asking about the type of characteristics or properties of something<br />
        Do use this when giving somebody options to choose from</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">어느:</span><br />
        Don’t use this when asking about the type of characteristics or properties of something<br />
        Don’t use this when asking about something that you can’t expect the answer for</p>
      <p>However,<br />
        Do use this when giving somebody options to choose from</p>
      <p>Here are a bunch of similar examples which each word being used:</p>

      <p>무슨 쪽으로 가고 싶어요? <em>– This would generally not be said in Korean. You would most likely say this when standing

          the following would be used instead:</em><br />

      <p>This is a good start, but there are other specific situations when you might use one of these words. For
        example, 어느 has other usages as well. You will learn about some of the other usages of 어느 in <a

      <h3><a name="2210"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How many (</span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">몇</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)___ (words with
          counters)</span></p>
      <p>Before I explain how to ask somebody “how many ____?” as in “how many cars do you have?” let’s review how to
        say “I have # cars.” Remember that you need to use counters in these types of sentences:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-24.mp3">저는 차 두 대가 있어요</a> = I
        have 2 cars<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Lesson10-Feb-10-3.mp3">나는 어제 친구 다섯 명을
          만났어</a> = I met five friends yesterday<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-46.mp3">저는 그 영화를 다섯 번 봤어요</a> = I
        saw that movie five times
      </p>
      <p>If you want to ask “how many ___?” you must include “몇” before the counter:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-25.mp3">차가 몇 대 있어요?</a> = How
        many cars do you have?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-26.mp3">친구를 몇 명 만났어요?</a> = How
        many friends did you meet?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-49.mp3">어제 학교에 몇 번 갔어요?</a> = How
        many times did you go to school yesterday?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s8.mp3">파일을 몇 개 보냈어요?</a> = How
        many files did you send?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s9.mp3">치마를 몇 개 샀어요?</a> = How
        many skirts did you buy?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s10.mp3">그 종이를 몇 번 찢었어요?</a> =
        How many times did you rip that paper?
      </p>
      <p>Notice the difference in the placement of the particles. When you say “몇 번” or “몇 대” or “몇 명” you have
        essentially created a question word. Just like most other question words, particles are not typically attached.
        Nonetheless, if you placed the particles after “몇 ___”, your questions would still be understood, but to me it
        is more natural to place them after the noun that you are asking about, and not after the counter. Just to show
        you, these would be understandable, and it probably just depends on the speaker who says them:</p>
      <p>차 몇 대가 있어요? = How many cars do you have?<br />
        친구 몇 명을 만났어요? = How many friends did you meet?</p>
      <p>Also make sure not to confuse these types of sentences with these similar sentences you learned in a previous
        lesson:<br />
        (저는) 차 몇 대가 있어요 = I have some cars<br />
        (저는) 어제 학교에 몇 번 갔어요 = I went to school some times (a few times) yesterday<br />
        (저는) 친구를 몇 명 만났어요 = I met some friends</p>
      <p>The difference between the first three sentences and the last three sentences is the first three are questions
        and the last three are statements. Remember when you are asking a question that the intonation needs to rise at
        the end of the sentence.</p>
      <p align="left">By using 몇 ___ you can also ask “how old are you?” and “what time is it?”:</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-53.mp3">몇 시예요?</a> =
        What time is it?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-54.mp3">몇 살이에요?</a> = How old are
        you?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-55.mp3">너의 남동생은 몇 살이야?</a> = How
        old is your younger brother?
      </p>
      <h3><a name="2211"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much, How many: 얼마나<br />
        </span></p>
      <p>The word “얼마나” can be placed before adjectives and adverbs to mean “how.” In these cases, the speaker is asking
        to what extent something occurs. For example:</p>
      <p>Adjectives<br />
        얼마나 짧다 = how short<br />
        얼마나 예쁘다 = how pretty<br />
        얼마나 많다 = how much/many</p>
      <p>Adverbs<br />
        얼마나 자주 = how often<br />
        얼마나 빨리 = how quickly<br />
        얼마나 잘 = how well</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-56.mp3">한국어를 얼마나 자주 공부해요?</a> =
        How often do you study Korean?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-57.mp3">여자 친구는 얼마나 예뻐요?</a> = How
        pretty is your girlfriend?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-58.mp3">축구를 얼마나 잘 해요?</a> = How
        well do you play soccer?
      </p>
      <p>It can also be used before verbs when the speaker is not making a distinction between countable objects in
        his/her question. Instead, the speaker’s inquiry falls within an uncountable continuum. For example, notice the
        difference between these two questions:</p>
      <p>How many pieces did you eat?<br />
        <em>Speaker is making a distinction between countable objects</em>
      </p>
      <p>How much did you eat?<br />
        <em>Speaker is not making a distinction between countable objects. Here, the speaker’s inquiry falls within an
          uncountable continuum.</em>
      </p>
      <p>When used like this with a verb, the most common translation for “얼마나” is “how much.” For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-27.mp3">빵을 얼마나 먹었어요?</a> = How
        much bread did you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-28.mp3">그 여자를 얼마나 사랑해요?</a> = How
        much do you love that girl?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-29.mp3">돈을 얼마나 가져갈 거예요?</a> = How
        much money will you take?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-30.mp3">물을 얼마나 마셨어요?</a> = How
        much water did you drink?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s11.mp3">그 책상은 자리를 얼마나 차지해요?</a>
        = How much space does that desk take up?
      </p>
      <p>The adverb 많이 is sometimes used in these sentences, and creates essentially the same meaning. In fact, the
        translation usually would not change when using 많이 in these types of sentences. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-31.mp3">빵을 얼마나 많이 먹었어요?</a> =
        How much bread did you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-32.mp3">그 여자를 얼마나 많이 사랑해요?</a> =
        How much do you love that girl?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-33.mp3">돈을 얼마나 많이 가져갈 거예요?</a> =
        How much money will you take?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-34.mp3">물을 얼마나 많이 마셨어요?</a> = How
        much water did you drink?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s12.mp3">그 책상은 자리를 얼마나 많이
          차지해요?</a> = How much space does that desk take up?
      </p>
      <p>Using 많이 in the sentences above just stresses that the speaker knows that the answer is “a lot” (remember, the
        meaning of 많이 is “a lot” or “many”), and is sort of asking “okay, I know it is a lot, but <em>how much </em>a
        lot?” (I realize that sentence is grammatically incorrect).</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
      <p>많이 (the adverb) can also be used as 많다 (the adjective) in these sentences. The meaning is still the same, but
        the structure of the sentence changes so 많다 describes the noun in question. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s13.mp3">얼마나 많은 빵을 먹었어요?</a> =
        How much bread did you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s15.mp3">얼마나 많은 돈을 가져갈 거예요?</a> =
        How much money will you take?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s16.mp3">얼마나 많은 물을 마셨어요?</a> =
        How much water did you drink?
      </p>
      <p>Although correct and understandable, I highly suggest you refrain from using this style of sentence. It sounds
        much more natural to say &#8220;빵을 얼마나 먹었어요?&#8221; or &#8220;빵을 얼마나 많이 먹었어요?&#8221; instead of &#8220;얼마나 많은 빵을
        먹었어요?&#8221;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
      <p>When the speaker <em>is </em>making a distinction between countable objects, the counter should be used as you
        learned in the previous section. For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-35.mp3">빵을 몇 개 먹었어요?</a> = How
        many pieces of bread did you eat?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-36.mp3">몇 명의 여자를 사랑해요?</a> = How
        many girls do you love?
      </p>
      <p>Note that although “얼마나” translates to “how” in all of these usages above. This is different from the usage of
        어떻게 which also translates to “how” in English.</p>
      <p>Notice the difference between the use of “how” in the sentences below:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-56.mp3">한국어를 얼마나 자주 공부해요?</a> =
        How often do you study Korean?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Lesson22-2.mp3">한국어를 어떻게 배웠어요?</a> = How
        did you learn Korean?
      </p>
      <p>The word “얼마” can be used to ask how much something costs.<br />
        <em>얼마나</em><em> and </em><em>얼마</em><em> are technically not the same word. However, I am presenting
        </em><em>얼마</em><em> in this form here because it is very common and it is in the form of a question.</em>
      </p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-38.mp3">그 로션이 얼마예요?</a> = How
        much is that lotion?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-39.mp3">저 바지가 얼마예요?</a> = How
        much are those pants?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-22-s17.mp3">벌금은 얼마였어요?</a> = How
        much was the fine?<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-37.mp3">이게 얼마예요?</a> = How much
        is this?
      </p>
      <p><em>Remember, </em>이게<em>, </em>그게<em> and </em>저게<em> are contractions of </em>이것이<em>, </em>그것이<em> and
        </em>저것이<em> respectively.</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>I just want to point out that it is possible to use most of these question words by themselves to ask for more
        information about a situation. If somebody is talking, and you want more information about who, what, when,
        where, why or how something occurs, you can use 누구, 뭐, 언제, 어디, 왜 or 어떻게 by themselves as questions. I don’t show
        this, but you can also add “요” after any of these words if you are speaking in a more formal situation. For
        example:</p>
      <p><u>왜<br />
        </u>In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">Lesson
          21</a>, you saw that you can use this when somebody calls you, for example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-23.mp3">슬기야!</a> =
        Seulgi!<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-21-23.mp3">왜?</a> =
        Why/what do you want?</p>
      <p>It can also be used by itself to ask “why” something occurs. For example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: 저는 내일 캐나다에 갈 거예요 = Tomorrow, I will go to Canada<br />
        Person 2: 왜? = Why (will you go to Canada tomorrow)?</p>
      <p><u>언제<br />
        </u>Person 1: 저는 캐나다에 갈 거예요 = I will go to Canada<br />
        Person 2: 언제? = When (will you go to Canada)?</p>
      <p><u>어디<br />
        </u>Person 1: 저는 내일 갈 거예요 = I will go tomorrow<br />
        Person 2: 어디? = Where (will you go tomorrow)?</p>
      <p><u>누구<br />
        </u>Person 1: 내일 그 사람을 만날 거예요 = I will meet that person tomorrow<br />
        Person 2: 누구(를)? = Who(m) (will you meet)?</p>
      <p>You can use 누가 by itself when asking about the acting agent of a sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>Person 1: 내일 어떤 사람이 여기 올 거예요 = Tomorrow, some person will come here<br />
        Person 2: 누가? = Who (will come here)?</p>
      <p><u>어떻게<br />
        </u>Person 1: 저는 공항에 갈 거예요 = I will go to the airport<br />
        Person 2: 어떻게? = How (will you go to the airport)?</p>
      <p><u>뭐<br />
        </u>You saw this already in this lesson:</p>
      <p>Person 1: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-7.mp3">저는 많이 먹었어요</a>
        = I ate a lot<br />
        Person 2: <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Lesson-22-7.mp3">뭐(를)?</a> =
        what? (you ate a lot of what?)</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>That’s it for asking questions in Korean! There was a <em>lot </em>of content in this lesson and the one before
        it (<a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-17-25-2/lesson-21-asking-questions-in-korean-why-when-where-and-who/">Lesson
          21</a>). Make sure you review those concepts a lot, because they are very important!</p>
      <p>Before we move on to the next lesson, though, we need to revisit ~는/은 and ~이/가 again.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="visit2"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~는/은 and ~이/가 Revisited (again)</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Now that you have continued to increase your understanding of Korean grammar over the
        past few lessons – and specifically learned how to ask questions in Korean, I can continue to explain the
        nuances between ~이/가 and ~는/은.</p>
      <p>Assuming that the situation is not set up in a way that would be grammatically appropriate to compare yourself
        with somebody else, it would be very awkward for you to say the following:</p>
      <p>내가 밥을 먹었어</p>
      <p>If you just walked into a room without anybody saying anything to you, or without any prior back-story, and
        simply said “내가 밥을 먹었어” (despite being able to understand you perfectly) it would sound very awkward to Korean
        people.</p>
      <p>When you use ~이/가 over ~는/은, the speaker is putting an enormous amount of stress on the fact that it was <span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">that particular subject</span> that did the action. The speaker isn’t
        comparing anything, but specifically stressing that it was the subject who/that does the action in the sentence
        (or has the properties described by the adjective, or “is” the thing attached to 이다). Again, this is just a
        nuance, and cannot be expressed in translation to English. The only way it can be explained is through
        descriptions.</p>
      <p>The reason why “내가 밥을 먹었어” sounds weird is because it is just like walking into a room and saying:</p>
      <p>“I am the one who ate rice!”<br />
        <em>Note here that I wouldn’t actually translate </em>“내가 밥을 먹었어”<em> to “I am the one who ate rice.” I would
          still translate it to “I ate.” I am using the translation “I am the one who ate” to show how the stress can be
          on the subject.</em><br />
        Nobody would ever say that without anything prompting a person to say it. Instead, you would just say:
      </p>
      <p>나는 밥을 먹었어 = I ate rice<br />
        Note that here, you are not comparing anything. You are also not stating a general fact. You are just indicating
        the subject of the sentence. How can I know that nothing is being compared? How can I know that this isn’t just
        a general fact? How can I know that ~는/은 is just acting as a plain old subject marker?</p>
      <p>I am going to reiterate what I said in Lesson 17:<br />
        This is precisely what causes the confusion amongst foreigners when trying to distinguish the difference between
        ~이/가 and ~는/은. Both of them can be used to express more than one nuance. The <em>only</em> way you can
        distinguish between the particular nuances being used is by understanding the situation in which they are used.
      </p>
      <p>The whole process of distinguishing ~이/가 from ~는/은 is incredibly confusing. I want to share an important phrase
        that I came up with that you should always think about when trying to learn the purposes of these
        particles:<br />
        “It’s not about understanding them – it’s about understanding when to use them.”</p>
      <p>At this point I would like to dive a little bit deeper into this purpose of stressing the subject of a
        sentence. Like I said, to have this purpose, it would need some sort of back-story indicating why the speaker
        would need to stress the subject.</p>
      <p>It would be weird in most situations to just say the following as a one-off sentence:</p>
      <p>내가 학생이야<br />
        … this is just like walking into a room and saying “It is me who is a/the student!”</p>
      <p>However, imagine two students in a class arguing about who gets to sit in the front row (the best seats in the
        class). After arguing for a few minutes, the class president can come in and say:</p>
      <p>내가 반장이야! = I am the class president! (반장 = class president)</p>
      <p>In this situation, the speaker is stressing that it is he/she that is the class president, and therefore has
        the power to solve the situation.</p>
      <p>I waited until Lesson 22 to talk about this usage because now you know how to ask questions. The particle ~이/가,
        in its usage as a subject stressor, is used when somebody specifically asks “<em>who</em>” did a particular
        action.</p>
      <p>For example, in the following dialogue:</p>
      <p>누가 밥을 먹었어? = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> ate the rice?<br />
        내가 밥을 먹었어 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> ate the rice<br />
        This could also be shortened to only include the subject:<br />
        내가 = “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> did”, or “<span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">me</span>”</p>
      <p>Another example:<br />
        누가 피자를 만들었어? = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> made the pizza?<br />
        내가 만들었어 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> made it (me)</p>
      <p>Notice here that just because (in English) somebody asks a “who” question doesn’t mean that ~이/가 must be used
        on the subject. This is only relevant when the speaker is asking “who” the subject was – and not who the object
        was (in effect, when “who” translates to 누가 and not to 누구”).</p>
      <p>누가 그녀를 좋아해? = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> likes her?<br />
        내가 그녀를 좋아해 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span> like her<br />
        Notice above the question is asking who the subject is</p>
      <p>너는 누구를 좋아해? = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who</span> do you like?<br />
        나는 그녀를 좋아해 = I like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span><br />
        Notice above the question is asking who the object is. The use of “는” on the subject takes the stress off of the
        subject and “는” just acts as a subject marker.</p>
      <p>The same thing can be done with other question words, as long as the question is asking for the subject. For
        example:</p>
      <p>어떤 것이 더 좋아요? = Which one is better?<br />
        이것이 더 좋아요 = This one is better</p>
      <p>I can’t stress enough that all of these nuances are all situational.<br />
        A particular sentence with ~는/은 can make sense in one situation, but could be awkward in another situation. That
        same sentence might be awkward with ~이/가 in one situation, but appropriate in another situation. In some
        situations, they could be exactly the same. Ask a Korean person to distinguish between the following:</p>
      <p>내 친구가 밥을 먹었다<br />
        내 친구는 밥을 먹었다</p>
      <p>They will tell you that – depending on the situation – they could be exactly the same. It entirely depends on
        the nuance that the speaker is trying to make.</p>
      <p>Before we finish, I would like to organize everything that we’ve done and try to describe the usages of ~는/은
        and ~이/가 very quickly. Notice that I say “try.” It is almost impossible to do this in any form, let alone in
        just a few sentences. Korean people literally write their doctoral theses on this topic. Nonetheless, here we
        go:</p>
      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~는/은:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1) To denote a subject of a sentence. For example:<br />
          나는 밥을 먹었다 = I ate rice<br />
          내 친구는 밥을 먹었다 = My friend ate rice<br />
          나는 그녀를 좋아해 = I like her<br />
          This may or may not have an overlapped meaning with the following purposes:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>2) To compare something. For example:<br />
          이 산은 높다 = This mountain is high (but maybe another mountain is low)<br />
          사과는 빨갛다. 바나나는 노랗다 = Apples are red. Bananas are yellow.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>3) To state a general fact. For example:<br />
          로키산은 높다 = The Rocky Mountains are high<br />
          여름 날씨는 좋다 = Summer weather is good (nice)<br />
          다이아몬드는 딱딱하다 = Diamonds are hard<br />
          사과는 빨갛다 = Apples are red</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">~이/가:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1) To denote a subject of a sentence. For example:<br />
          고양이가 집 뒤에 있다 = The cat is behind the house<br />
          This may or may not have an overlapped meaning with the following purposes:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>2) To indicate something based on a recent experience/observation. For example:<br />
          날씨가 좋다 = The weather is nice!<br />
          비가 와요 = It’s raining!<br />
          사과가 파랗다 = The apple is blue</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>3) To stress that the subject does the action (or is the adjective). For example:<br />
          누가 그녀를 좋아해? = Who likes her?<br />
          &#8211; 내가 그녀를 좋아해 = I like her<br />
          내가 반장이야! = I am the class president!</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>4) Placed on objects in sentences that are predicated by adjectives. For example:<br />
          나는 학교가 싫다 = I don’t like school<br />
          나는 그것이 좋다 = I like that<br />
          나는 펜이 있다 = I have a pen</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>5) Placed on the object before 아니다 to indicate what something is not. For example:<br />
          나는 학생이 아니다 = I am not a student<br />
          나는 의사가 아니다 = I am not a doctor</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>6) Placed on the object predicated by “되다” to indicate what something becomes. For example:<br />
          나는 의사가 되고 싶다 = I want to become a doctor<br />
          나는 선생님이 되고 싶다 = I want to become a teacher</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: left;">In <a
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-14-korean-passive-verbs/">Lesson
          14</a> you also learned about creating passive sentences with verbs that act in the “state” of something. For
        example:</p>
      <p>문이 열려 있다 = The door is open</p>
      <p>In that lesson, I told you that you should use ~이/가 on the object that is in the state of something. I can only
        assume that the purpose of this is what is described in number 2) above. That is, “the door being open” is not
        some general statement because (obviously) not all doors are open. Rather, the speaker is referring to a
        particular door in a particular situation that is open, and thus, requires the use of ~이/가. Adding ~는/은 to “문”
        (or any other object in that situation) would only be acceptable in a comparison situation.</p>
      <p>One last time before we put this to bed for a while:<br />
        Your understanding of this will progress along with your understanding of Korean in general. Through Lesson 2,
        17 and 22 I hope you have a better understanding of this. However, I know that you will still be confused. Don’t
        worry, that is normal, and I promise your understanding will evolve as you keep progressing with your Korean.
      </p>
      <p>In our later lessons, you will continue to be introduced to when it is more appropriate to use either ~는/은 or
        ~이/가. For now, focus on what we have learned so far.</p>
