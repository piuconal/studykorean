        <p>Sometimes you will find two verbs connected by “~아/어”. This grammatical principle is fairly complex and isn’t
          discussed in great detail until <a
            href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-3-intermediate-korean-grammar/lessons-67-75/lesson-70/">Lesson
            70</a>.</p>
        <p>A basic explanation for now is that “~아/어” essentially has no real meaning, and that the meaning of both
          verbs comes out. “버리다” is probably the most common verb that you will find after a verb and ~아/어.
          Constructions in this format “(verb + ~아/어 + 버리다) add emotion to a sentence. The emotion is as if something
          was “thrown away” or done without any real thinking of the consequences. Some quick examples:</p>
        <p>끄다= to turn off<br />
          꺼 버리다= to turn off (with that added emotion)</p>
        <p>가다= to go<br />
          가 버리다= to go (with that added emotion)</p>
        <p>잊다= to forget<br />
          잊어버리다= to forget (with that added emotion)</p>
        <p>Notice that 잃어버리다 and 잊어버리다 are actually independent words – whereas the other examples include a space (two
          verbs with a grammatical principle separating them)</p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
          저는 열쇠를 <strong>잃어버렸어요</strong> = I <strong>lost</strong> my keys<br />
          저는 아이를 <strong>잃어버려</strong>서 걱정이 되었어요= I was worried because I <strong>lost</strong> the baby)<br />

        <p>부끄럽다 follows the ㅂ irregular</p>
        <p>Notes: This word is more common than you would think. Korean people are generally very shy and thus, this
          word is used a lot. It is an irregular adjective. See Lesson 7 for more information.</p>
        <p>Example: 제가 너무 <strong>부끄러워서</strong> 발표를 못해요 = I can’t do presentations because I am so <strong>shy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The addition of ~아/어하다 is commonly done when the speaker is not the person who is shy. This grammar is

      <h3><a name="conj"></a></h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conjugating </span><span
          style="text-decoration: underline;">이다</span></p>
      <p>In earlier lessons, you learned a lot about conjugating verbs and adjectives. Exactly three things can be
        conjugated in Korean: verbs, adjectives <em>and</em> 이다. The conjugation of 이다 is different than verbs and
        adjectives. Actually, there are many times where 이다 behaves differently than verbs and adjectives &#8211; which
        you will learn in future lessons. In this lesson, you will learn how to conjugate 이다, and you will see how the
        conjugation differs from verbs and adjectives. The sentence below shows the plain form, present tense
        conjugation of 이다, which you have seen in lessons up to this point:</p>
      <p>나는 선생님이다 = I am a teacher</p>
      <p>If the last letter of the noun before 이다 ends in a vowel, you can eliminate 이. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 의사다 = I am a doctor<br />
        나는 의사이다 = I am a doctor</p>
      <p>Both of the above can be seen as correct. Here, the pronunciation of “이” is merging with the pronunciation of
        the vowel in the noun. If you pronounce the two sentences above, you can see that there is very little
        difference.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if the last letter of the noun before 이다 is a consonant, this merging cannot happen. For example:
      </p>
      <p>나는 선생님이다 = I am a teacher (correct)<br />
        나는 선생님다 – incorrect</p>
      <p>This merging of 이다 does not happen because it has nothing to merge with. Furthermore, if you try to pronounce
        “선생님다”, it just doesn’t flow properly. It is hard to get your mouth to move from the “ㅁ” sound immediately to
        the “ㄷ” sound. This same principle occurs in other conjugations of 이다, but it is a little bit more complex.</p>
      <p>In almost every case, you can conjugate 이다 differently depending on if the noun it is being attached to ends in
        a vowel or consonant. The reason they are conjugated differently is similar to the example above with 의사다 vs.
        의사이다. Here, the pronunciation of “이” is being merged with something, and can therefore disappear. You will learn
        about each conjugation specifically, but I will give you an example here to prepare you for all the future
        explanations. Try not to worry about the meanings of these sentences, and just focus on what I am presenting.
      </p>
      <p>As you will learn later, when conjugating 이다 into the past tense in the plain form, &#8220;었다&#8221; is added
        to the stem of “이다” (이). This is actually quite simple for you to understand, because every other verb and
        adjective follows this same rule. For example:</p>
      <p>의사이었다<br />
        선생님이었다</p>
      <p>However, the pronunciation of 이었다 can merge to “였다” when the noun that it is being attached to ends in a vowel.
        For example, both of these are correct:</p>
      <p>의사이었다<br />
        의사였다</p>
      <p>Pronounce both of those, and listen to how little of a difference there is between the two. Not only that, the
        pronunciation of both of those is very easy and it flows off the tongue.</p>
      <p>Conversely, 이 and 었다 <em>cannot</em> merge when the noun it is added to ends in a consonant. For example:</p>
      <p>선생님이었다 – correct<br />
        선생님였다 – incorrect</p>
      <p>Pronounce both of those and listen the difference. Not only that,‘선생님였다’ is hard to pronounce. It is difficult
        to move your mouth from the ㅁ sound directly to the 여 sound. It is much easier to pronounce it like this: 나는
        선생님-이-었-다.</p>
      <p>Although I am only talking about the past tense plain form in this example, this same rule applies in many
        situations. If you keep this in mind when learning the conjugations in this lesson, they will be much easier to
        grasp.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">이다 Present Tense</span></p>
      <p>Conjugating 이다 to the present tense is relatively confusing compared to the past tense because new syllables
        are added with no real logic behind them. Whereas past conjugations are simply done by connecting the stem
        &#8220;이&#8221; to the typical past tense addition of &#8220;었다&#8221;, present tense conjugations have
        additions that are not seen with any other verb or adjective. Let&#8217;s talk about these first.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The weird thing is that Korean speakers sometimes would use these:</p>
      <p>나는 학생이 아니<b>였</b>어<br />
        나는 학생이 아니<b>였</b>다<br />
        저는 학생이 아니<b>였</b>어요<br />
        저는 학생이 아니<b>였</b>습니다</p>
      <p>Just going by the rules of the language, I’d have to assume that the first set is correct. I base this on the
        fact that in no other word do we add “~였~” to a stem. In other words, “~였~” is created from “이 + 었,” but it is
        never added as a stand-alone thing.</p>

      <p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to actually conjugate verbs/adjectives to the
          Future Tense</span></p>
      <p>In <a title="Lesson 6: Korean Honorifics"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-6/">Lesson 6</a>, you learned
        how to conjugate words to the future tense by adding 겠어/겠어요/겠다/겠습니다 to the word stem. Though adding ~겠~ to a
        word stem is one way to conjugate words to the future, there is a more common way to conjugate to do this!</p>
      <p>Before learning how to do to this, you needed to learn more grammar first (namely, how to conjugate 이다
        properly). Either way, ~겠~ <strong>is </strong>still used in Korean, but not as much as the method you are about
        to learn.</p>
      <p>For verbs or adjectives, when conjugating into the future tense, you must first add ~ㄹ/을 to the stem of the
        word.</p>
      <p>When you add ~ㄹ/을 to a word stem, ~ㄹ gets attached directly to stems ending in a vowel, and ~을 gets added onto
        stems ending in a consonant. For example:</p>
      <p>가다 ends in a vowel, so<br />
        가다 + ㄹ = 갈</p>
      <p>먹다 ends in a consonant, so<br />
        먹다 + 을 = 먹을</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">This is going to sound extremely complicated (and it is): adding ~ㄹ/을 to the stem of
        an adjective changes it to a word that can describe a noun in the future tense. For example:</p>
      <p>행복한 사람 = happy person<br />
        행복할 사람 = a person that will be happy</p>
      <p>Similarly, (this is where it gets complicated) adding ~ㄹ/~을 to a stem of a <em>verb</em> turns it into a word
        that can describe a noun in the future.</p>
      <p>먹을 음식 = the food that will be eaten</p>
      <p>In practice, entire clauses &#8211; ending in verbs, which in turn describe the noun &#8211; are commonly used.
        For example:</p>
      <p>제가 먹을 음식 = the food that will be eaten by me (the food that I will eat)</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
      <p>If you can’t understand the explanation between the lines – don’t worry. That level of grammar is very
        difficult to grasp at this stage of learning. That grammar will be discussed very deeply in <a
          title="Lesson 26: ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs"
          href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit-2-lower-intermediate-korean-grammar/unit-2-lessons-26-33/lesson-26/">Lessons
          26 – 29</a>. If you want to jump ahead to those lessons, feel free. However, the mechanics within the grammar
        are not important to you yet. For now, these are the three major points I want you to think about:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Adding ~ㄹ/~을 to the stem of an adjective allows that adjective to describe a noun in the future tense</li>
        <li>Adding ~ㄹ/~을 to the stem of a verb allows that verb to describe a noun in the future tense</li>
        <li>Because these newly formed words can describe nouns, they <strong>must</strong> be followed by a noun</li>
      </ol>
      <p>What does all this have to do with conjugating into the future?</p>
      <p>When Korean people conjugate to the future, they usually do so by adding ~ㄹ/~을 to a verb/adjective.<br />
        This is essentially the same as adding ㄴ/은 to an adjective stem which you already know: (좋다 -&gt; 좋은).<br />
        You should know, however, that you cannot <em>end</em> a sentence like this:</p>
      <p>나는 좋은</p>
      <p>Because 좋은 is an adjective that modifies a noun, a noun <strong>must</strong> follow 좋은:</p>
      <p>나는 좋은 사람</p>
      <p>Now, to end the sentence, you need to add 이다 to the noun:</p>
      <p>나는 좋은 사람이다 = I am a good person.</p>
      <p>So, again, when Korean people conjugate verbs/adjectives to the future, they usually do so by adding ~ㄹ/~을 to
        the word stem:</p>
      <p>나는 행복할<br />
        나는 먹을<br />
        나는 공부할</p>
      <p>But this changes verbs/adjectives into an adjectives that describe nouns. Therefore, (just like 좋은) a noun
        <strong>must</strong> follow these words. The noun that is always used in this situation is 것 (thing):
      </p>
      <p>나는 행복할 것<br />
        나는 먹을 것<br />
        나는 공부할 것</p>
      <p>Now, to end those sentences, you need to add 이다 to the noun:</p>
      <p>나는 행복할 것이다<br />
        나는 먹을 것이다<br />
        나는 공부할 것이다</p>
      <p>If you try to directly translate these sentences to English, they have the meaning:</p>
      <p>I am a thing who will be happy<br />
        I am a thing who will eat<br />
        I am a thing who will study</p>
      <p>But their actual meanings are:</p>
      <p>나는 행복할 것이다 = I will be happy<br />
        나는 먹을 것이다 = I will eat<br />
        나는 공부할 것이다 = I will study</p>
      <p>The 이다 can then be conjugated based on the level of politeness or formality. But keep in mind that even though
        this sentence is conjugated into the future, the 이다 should stay in the present tense. Because the ~ㄹ/을 creates a
        future sentence, 이다 does not need to be in the future.</p>
      <p>것 is also sometimes shortened to 거, for no other reason than it is easier to say and creates a shorter
        sentence. For example, these two are exactly the same:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-9-20-I-will-eat-rice.mp3">저는 밥을 먹을
          것이에요</a> = I will eat rice<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lesson-9-21-I-will-eat-rice.mp3">저는 밥을 먹을
          거예요</a> = I will eat rice
      </p>
      <p><em>Notice that </em>~이에요<em> is added when </em>것<em> (which ends in a consonant) is used and </em>~예요<em> is
          added when </em>거<em> (which ends in a vowel) is used. This is the same rule that you learned <a
            href="#ipresihr">earlier in the lesson</a> when conjugating </em>이다<em> depending on if the final letter of
          a noun ends in a consonant or vowel.<br />
        </em></p>
      <p><em>Note that Korean people are often confused if they need to add</em> &#8220;~이에요,&#8221; <em>or</em>
        &#8220;~예요&#8221; <em>or</em> &#8220;~에요&#8221; <em>to</em> 거 <em>in these cases. Therefore, it is not uncommon
          to see somebody use</em> &#8220;할 거에요.&#8221;</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-1-8/unit-1-lesson-7/">Lesson 7</a>, you
        learned how irregular words change as a result of adding different additions. This is the first time you have
        been introduced to adding ~ㄹ/을. Let’s look at how irregulars change as a result of adding this grammatical
        principle.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ㅅ irregular, ㄷ irregular and ㅂ irregular all follow the same rules that were introduced in Lesson 7. The
          addition of the vowel causes a change (or elimination) of the last letter of the stem.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The ㅡ and 르 irregular are not affected by this addition.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding ~ㄹ/을 to a word that follows the ㄹ irregular brings about a change you are not familiar with.
          Normally, you would add ~ㄹ to the stem of a word ending in a vowel, and ~을 to the stem of a word ending in a
          consonant.
          <ul>
            <li>For example: 잃다 + ~ㄹ/을 = 잃을<br />
              예쁘다 + ~ㄹ/을 = 예쁠</li>
            <li>However, when you add ~ㄹ/을 to a stem of a word that ends in ㄹ, the ㄹ is dropped and ㄹ is attached
              directly to the stem. In effect, you removed something and replace it with exactly the same thing. For
              example:갈다 + ㄹ/을 = 갈<br />
              빨다 + ㄹ/을 = 빨<br />
              열다 + ㄹ/을 = 열<br />
              <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lesson9-32I-will-open-the-door.mp3">저는
                문을 열 거예요</a> = I will open the door (열 + 을 = 열)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Below is a table showing the changes that result from adding ~ㄹ/을 to a word.</p>

      <p>Notice that I also included the word 돕다. As you learned in Lesson 7 – ㅂ changes to 오 when ~아/어 (or any
        derivative) is added. When any other vowel is added, ㅂ changes to 우 as you can see above.</p>
      <p>You will see these same changes to irregulars anytime you add something that begins in ~ㄹ/을. For example:</p>

          style="text-decoration: underline;">이다</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> &#8211; Using
        </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">되다</span></p>
      <p>Conjugating 이다 to the future tense is the same as is done above, but it is also possible to use another verb;
        되다. 되다 is one of the hardest words in Korean, mainly because it has so many meanings. You will be introduced to
        each of these meanings as you progress through our lessons, but the first meaning of ‘되다’ is “to become”… which
        is slightly different than “to be”. Let me introduce the word “되다” to you by showing you examples of it being
        used in the past tense:</p>
      <p><em>(Note the way </em>되다<em> is used. </em>~이/가<em> is attached to the noun that the subject “becomes” instead
          of </em>~를/을<em>)</em></p>
      <p>저는 선생님이 되었어요 = I became a teacher<br />
        Which is slightly different than:<br />
        저는 선생님이었어요 = I was a teacher</p>
      <p>Very similar, but the difference between “to become” and “to be” (which in this case is in the past tense of
        ‘was’) is “become” suggests that prior to that time, the situation was different. I’m sure you get it, but let
        me describe it using English examples:</p>
      <p>I became a teacher last year<br />
        I was a teacher last year</p>
      <p>When you say “I became a teacher last year”, you are indicating that – before last year you were not a teacher
        – but last year you became a teacher.</p>
      <p>When you say “I was a teacher last year”, you are not specifying if you were a teacher before that time as
        well, or even if you are still a teacher. All you are specifying is that you were a teacher last year, and no
        other information is given.</p>
      <p>되다 can be used in the present tense as well (and again differs slightly from 이다). I&#8217;ll save examples for
        when I&#8217;ve presented more grammar principles further into the course. My whole purpose in mentioning it is
        to explain the application to the future tense. First off, it is awkward to conjugate 이다 to the future tense
        using ~겠다.</p>
      <p>나는 선생님이겠다</p>
      <p>If you want to say that something “will be” something in the future, because of the nature of the word “되다”
        there is no real difference if you use 되다 or 이다. For example:</p>

      <p><em>I just want to point out here that the &#8220;</em>일<em>&#8221; you are seeing above is not the word
          &#8220;</em>일<em>&#8220;. Rather it is the future conjugation (using the conjugation taught in the lesson) of
        </em>이다. 선생님이다<em> becomes </em>선생님 + 이다 + ~ㄹ/을 것이다<em>.</em></p>
      <p>As you build vocabulary, you will be able to apply this same format of sentences to create sentences like:</p>
      <p>This place will become a park next year<br />
        I will become a doctor in a few months</p>
      <p><em>In <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/unit1/unit-1-lessons-9-16/lesson-11/">Lesson 11</a>, you will
          learn the vocabulary necessary to create those types of sentences. </em></p>
      <p>The sentences above using 이다 and 되다 in the future tense can be used to make negative sentences as well. When
        making the negative form of a 되다 sentence, you can just add 안 or ~지 않다 just like with any other verb or
        adjective. When making the negative form of an 이다 sentence, you should use 아니다. You can change each pair of
        sentences above to a negative sentence. For example:</p>
      <p>나는 미래에 의사가 되지 않을 거야 = I won’t become a doctor in the future<br />
        나는 미래에 의사가 아닐 거야 = I won’t be a doctor in the future</p>
      <p>한국이 곧 좋은 나라가 되지 않을 거야 = Korea won’t become a good country soon<br />
        한국이 곧 좋은 나라가 아닐 거야 = Korea won’t be a good country soon</p>
      <p>이 장소는 공원이 되지 않을 거야 = This place won’t become a park<br />
        이 장소는 공원이 아닐 거야 = This place won’t be a park</p>
      <p>Those sentences, while kind of ridiculous, are all grammatically correct. I can’t think of any time when you
        would actually want to say a sentence like that, but they are all possible if the right situation came up. Most
        of the time, there would be a better way to say each of the sentences above. For example, instead of saying:</p>
      <p>나는 미래에 의사가 되지 않을 거야 = I won’t become a doctor in the future</p>
      <p>It would probably be more natural to say something like “I don’t want to become a doctor in the future.” You
        will learn how to say this, and other grammatical principles that can make your speech more natural as you
        progress along with your studies. For now, try to understand what is being done grammatically, and don’t worry
        too much about when you would actually use a sentence like that.</p>
      <p>One other quick thing; and I really don’t want to spend too much time on this because I have already
        overwhelmed you with grammar in this lesson. However, the future conjugation of 이다 is introduced in this lesson
        and I feel this needs to be talked about here. By using the future ~ㄹ/을 것이다 conjugation on 이다, you can also
        create a sentence where the speaker is guessing about a certain situation in the present tense. Look at some
        examples first:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s5.mp3">그 사람이 의사일 거예요</a> = That
        person is probably/most likely a doctor<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s6.mp3">그것은 여권일 거예요</a> = That
        thing is probably/most likely a passport<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s7.mp3">문제는 돈일 거예요</a> = The
        problem is probably/most likely money
      </p>
      <p><em>Remember, you are not adding </em>일<em> to these nouns. You are adding </em>~이다<em> followed by adding
        </em>~ㄹ 것이다 <em>to </em>이다<em>. I get a lot of questions from learners asking me where this
          &#8220;</em>일<em>&#8221; came from. </em></p>
      <p>These sentences as well can be said using 아니다 instead of 이다:</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s8.mp3">그 사람이 의사가 아닐 거야</a> =
        That person is probably/most likely not a doctor<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s9.mp3">그것은 여권이 아닐 거야</a> = That
        thing is probably/most likely not a passport<br />
        <a href="https://www.howtostudykorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lesson-9-s10.mp3">문제는 돈이 아닐 거야</a> = The
        problem is probably/most likely not money
      </p>
      <p>Notice that in these cases the speaker is not talking about him/herself. Also, even though the sentence is
        conjugated into the future tense, the speaker is guessing that something is the case in the present tense. Thus,
        it is weird to include time indicators in these sentences (for example “next year” or “in a few months from
        now”) because the speaker is not trying to create this meaning.</p>
      <p>The question then becomes – how can I distinguish if somebody is saying one of these “guessing” sentences or
        saying “something will become something”. You will learn continuously throughout your Korean studies that
        understanding a Korean sentence is all about context – and the situation almost always makes it clear what the
        speaker wants to express.</p>
      <p>For now, rather than concern yourself with guessing nuances, I suggest focusing on how to use the ~ㄹ/을 것이다 form
        to conjugate verbs/adjectives into the future tense – and realize that 되다 can be used instead of 이다 when
        conjugating to the future tense.</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s it for this lesson!</p>
